# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 3.1.2

- Fixes the browser and Electron Desktop window title to use the canonical
  `Powers Tool` product name instead of `Powers Tool WebUI`.
- Adds model-aware Protection feature metadata to `capabilities`, so external
  orchestrators can determine OVP, OCP, OCP delay, and delay trigger support.

## 3.1.1

- Expands English and Traditional Chinese CLI and WebUI operator guidance for
  RS-232 / ASRL setup, advanced safety-critical workflows, trigger and pulse
  behavior, and output workflow state.
- Clarifies the canonical documentation and bundled Help generation and
  synchronization workflow, with the tracked runtime Help regenerated from the
  maintained User Guides.

## 3.1.0

- Adds the `powers-tool manifest --json` machine introspection command for
  discovering tool identity, version, and Worker protocol compatibility
  without opening VISA resources or starting a Worker.
- Adds an opt-in in-memory Worker mode for orchestrators that want command
  results and telemetry through JSONL and Worker status without creating
  filesystem artifacts, while preserving the existing file-backed mode as
  the default.
- Improves the WebUI appearance and language controls with clearly labeled
  Appearance and Language settings. The language control now displays the
  current locale, and the dark theme has been refined for clearer visual
  hierarchy and control states.
- Adds a shared Powers application icon to the user-facing Windows Desktop,
  CLI, and WebUI Launcher, including the Launcher window and taskbar.
- Adds local, version-matched built-in Help for the CLI, browser WebUI, and
  Electron Desktop, with English and Traditional Chinese operator content.
- Adds offline model capability inspection through `powers-tool capabilities
  --model ...`, allowing Product-active model metadata, command support,
  electrical ratings, and hardware-validation status to be queried without
  opening VISA resources.  

## 3.0.0

- Adds Product LIVE support for the GW Instek PSM-2010 over ASRL / RS-232 +
  system VISA, with 23 model-aware commands covering read-only, output,
  protection, snapshot/restore, ramp, and software-sequence workflows.
- Adds range-aware electrical rating validation for instruments with multiple
  operating ranges, requiring combined voltage/current setpoints to fit an
  official range.
- Adds bounded Power Worker telemetry logging with job-local CSV/JSONL
  artifacts and cooperative cancellation.
- Expands Keysight E3646A ASRL + system VISA Product LIVE support with the
  telemetry `log` command.
- Adds the Electron Desktop shell with System, Light, and Dark themes.
- Adds the shared Windows onedir bundle and unified versioned Windows ZIP
  packaging flow.
- Adds multi-channel Ramp support and Ramp List v5 per-Segment channel
  selections while preserving legacy Ramp List compatibility.

## 2.0.0

- Updates the Common Worker, CLI JSON/JSONL, and orchestrator
  contracts to schema version 2 only for the shared `POST /command` mode/model
  context. Common fields are `mode`, live-only `expected_model_id`, and physical
  `planning_model_id`; project-specific contracts may define an additional
  planning identity without changing Common field meanings.
- Moves Powers Worker execution mode and model identity from command arguments
  to top-level `context`. Powers retains the dry-run-only, project-specific
  `planning_profile_id: "generic-scpi"`; queue, status, stop, cancellation,
  cleanup, artifacts, Product support, and hardware-evidence behavior remain
  unchanged.
- Renames the product from Keysight Powers to Powers Tool and the distribution
  from `keysight-powers` to `powers-tool`.
- Renames the Python packages to `powers_tool_core`, `powers_tool_cli`, and
  `powers_tool_webui`, and renames the CLI/WebUI entry points to `powers-tool`,
  `powers-tool-webui`, and `powers-tool-webui-launcher`.
- Removes old command, import-package, field, environment-variable, and schema
  compatibility aliases.
- Introduces vendor-qualified physical `model_id` values and requires reported
  manufacturer plus model to jointly resolve live identity. An expected model
  is a safety guard and never overrides the IDN-selected driver.
- Replaces the physical-model-like `GENERIC` identity with the no-hardware-only
  `generic-scpi` planning profile.
- Splits the ambiguous model-profile contract into `planning_model_id`,
  `expected_model_id`, and `planning_profile_id`.
- Moves affected public schemas to version 2 and changes the Ramp List
  discriminator to `powers-tool-ramp-list`.
- Migrates support policy to canonical `model_id` while preserving the exact
  Product-open and pending command, transport, backend, and feature boundaries.
- Preserves the documented Keysight hardware support boundaries during the
  identity migration. Product support remains limited to exact model, command,
  transport, backend, and required-feature scopes.
- Keeps Product release artifacts limited to the single `powers-tool`
  distribution and excludes repository validation scripts, private fixtures,
  candidate evidence, and internal-only tests.

## 1.0.0

- First stable release of `keysight-powers` for Keysight DC power supply
  workflows.
- Provides the shared Core runtime, `keysight-power` CLI, local WebUI server,
  and Windows WebUI launcher in one installable distribution.
- Supports USB and LAN VISA communication, simulator and dry-run workflows,
  JSON/JSONL automation output, ramp, sequence, trigger, snapshot, restore,
  and protection operations.
- Keeps real hardware output opt-in; default tests and simulator flows do not
  enable instrument output.
