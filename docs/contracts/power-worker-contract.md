# Power Worker Contract

This contract extends `common-worker-protocol.md` for Powers Tool power-supply operations.

## Endpoints

- `GET /status`: lifecycle status only. It is non-mutating and never opens VISA.
- `POST /command`: asynchronous Power command submission.
- `POST /cancel`: cooperative cancellation of the exact active workflow job.
- `POST /stop`: priority cooperative stop request.

`/trigger`, `trigger_url`, `--default-action`, and default-action config are not supported.

`POST /cancel` requires exactly schema version 2 and the active
`worker_job_id` (plus an optional string reason). Wrong, stale, completed, or
non-workflow identity fails closed. Ramp, Ramp List, and Sequence cancellation
does not shut down the Worker; successful cleanup returns it to `ready`.
`GET /status` does not need a `cancel_url` because the route is fixed.

## Power Stop Cleanup

`POST /stop` only sets stop state, wakes the background runner, and returns.
It performs no VISA I/O, cleanup, or HTTP-server shutdown in the handler.
The runner must finish command safety cleanup before the Worker stops the HTTP
server or emits the final `summary`.

Stop-only cleanup results use Power status values `succeeded`, `unsupported`,
`not_applicable`, and `failed`. Cleanup runs `release_to_local`, closes the
VISA session, then records `cleanup_release_to_local`; HTTP server shutdown
follows runner completion. `release_to_local` uses device-specific PyVISA GPIB
local control only when available. USB/LAN are `unsupported`; simulated or
unopened sessions are `not_applicable`. `cleanup_release_to_local` is
post-close bookkeeping and must not access the closed VISA session.

User cancellation of Ramp, Ramp List, or Sequence first stops future steps and
completion pulses. On the workflow's existing session it requests output OFF
for every supported channel, verifies each OFF, and drains the instrument error
queue to the no-error sentinel with a maximum of 20 reads. Session close and
hardware-lock release follow. Terminal `cancelled` is allowed only when every
stage succeeds; otherwise terminal status is `failed`, error code is
`cleanup_failed`, and result diagnostics preserve `original_reason:
user_cancelled`. Blocking VISA I/O is not forcibly interrupted.

Each result is emitted as a structured `power_cleanup` JSONL event.
Unsupported cleanup is a warning. Any failed release, close, or post-cleanup
makes final `summary.ok` false and Worker exit code `3`.

## `POST /command`

The request body is a strict JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "command": "read-status",
  "arguments": { "channel": "all", "dry_run": true },
  "job_id": "optional-orchestrator-id"
}
```

Allowed top-level fields are `schema_version`, `command`, `arguments`, and
`job_id`. `schema_version` is required and must be the exact integer `2`;
booleans, strings, floats, missing versions, and unsupported integers are
rejected. Unknown fields, malformed JSON, a non-object body, a
missing/non-string command, non-object `arguments`, non-string `job_id`,
unknown command names, and invalid Power arguments return `400` before any
VISA I/O, queue mutation, or artifact creation.

Every `/command` response is a JSON object with integer `schema_version: 2`,
`status`, `command`, and `job_id`. In the HTTP response, `command` is the
submitted command string, for example `"read-status"`.

- Accepted commands return `202` with `status: "accepted"`, `worker_job_id`, and `artifact_path`.
- Validation failures return `400` with `status: "error"`.
- Admission/safety rejections return `409` with `status: "rejected"` and one of the Power rejection reasons.

Power rejection reasons are `busy`, `run_not_ready`, `output_confirmation_required`, and `output_changes_not_allowed`.

`POST /command` HTTP `202` means only that the request was accepted and
enqueued. It does not mean the Power command has succeeded. Before returning
HTTP `202`, the Worker must create the job artifact directory and write
`request.json` successfully. If artifact initialization fails, the request
must not be reported as accepted.

`job_id` is the optional orchestrator ID from the request. It is echoed in
responses and runtime status but is not written into request/result artifacts
or measurement metadata. `worker_job_id` identifies the Worker artifact
directory and is the Worker job identity.

Power Worker job states are:

- `accepted`: the HTTP handler accepted the request.
- `queued`: the job artifact directory and `request.json` exist, and the job
  is waiting for the background runner.
- `running`: the background runner is executing the command.
- `succeeded`: terminal success.
- `failed`: terminal failure.
- `cancelled`: terminal cooperative stop/cancellation.

## `GET /status`

`GET /status` is non-mutating. It must not open VISA, execute a domain
command, mutate the queue, request stop, or create artifacts.

The response includes `schema_version`, `service`, `run_id`, Worker
`status`, `command_url`, `status_url`, `stop_url`, `queue_size`,
`active_job`, `last_job`, `fatal_error`, and `timestamp_utc`.
Its `schema_version` is the integer `2`.

`active_job` and `last_job`, when present, include at least `worker_job_id`,
`job_id`, `command`, `status`, and `artifact_path`. Top-level `job_id` is not
used for domain job identity.

## Commands

Read-only/status:

- `identify`
- `read-status`
- `readback`
- `measure`
- `measure-all`
- `output-state`
- `protection-status`
- `error`
- `snapshot`

Output/setpoint:

- `set`
- `apply`
- `output-on`
- `output-off`
- `safe-off`
- `cycle-output`
- `ramp`
- `ramp-list`
- `smoke-output`

Protection/restore/sequencing:

- `protection-set`
- `clear-protection`
- `restore-from-snapshot`
- `sequence`

Trigger:

- `trigger-pulse`
- `trigger-status`
- `trigger-step`
- `trigger-list`
- `trigger-fire`
- `trigger-abort`

These are Worker request names, not a blanket product LIVE allowlist. Worker
passes model-aware live requests to the shared Core boundary, which selects
the detected `*IDN?` model and requires an exact command/transport/backend
product scope. Missing and pending scopes fail closed, and Worker provides no
validation bypass. A command may remain useful in dry-run or simulator mode
without an accepted real-hardware scope.

Worker always operates in the product support-policy mode. Validation-policy
request or settings fields are rejected rather than ignored. Runtime identity
is selected per request with the three explicit V2 fields and is never a
support unlock.

## Arguments

Common `arguments` keys:

- `dry_run`: optional boolean, default `false`. When true, no VISA I/O is performed.
- `confirm_output`: optional boolean, default `false`. Required with Worker config `settings.allow_output_writes: true` for live non-dry-run output-affecting commands.
- `planning_model_id`: canonical physical model for dry-run planning or Worker
  simulator mode.
- `expected_model_id`: optional live-only safety guard; IDN resolution remains
  authoritative and selects the driver.
- `planning_profile_id`: nonphysical dry-run planning profile, currently only
  `generic-scpi`.

Worker live dry-run accepts exactly one planning field; live non-dry-run accepts
only the optional expected field; simulator mode accepts only the physical
planning field. Worker settings provide no identity default and reject all
identity fields, including legacy `model_profile` and `model`.

Command-specific fields match the CLI/core names, including `channel`,
`voltage`, `current`, `max_errors`, `max_reads`, `file`, `document`,
`snapshot`, `wait_timeout_ms`, `poll_ms`, protection options, snapshot
options, and sequence options. Raw JSON `channel` accepts an exact positive
integer or exact `"all"`; booleans, floats, numeric strings, null, arrays, and
objects are rejected before queue or artifact mutation. `"all"` is accepted
only by commands with all-channel selection;
for output commands, `"all"` is supported by `apply`, `safe-off`,
`output-on`, `output-off`, `output-state`, and `cycle-output`. `set`, `ramp`,
and `smoke-output` remain single-channel commands. `ramp-list` accepts `file`
or `document`; each segment selects one positive integer channel.

Restore snapshot documents must contain non-empty `outputs`, `readback`, and
`protection_settings` sections with exactly the same channel inventory. A
channel protection record is required even when each optional protection
field is null; incomplete snapshots are rejected instead of partially
restored.

`set` arguments require `channel` plus `voltage`, `current`, or both. An
omitted setpoint is left unchanged on the instrument and must not be replaced
with zero or readback-derived values. Requests with neither `voltage` nor
`current` return HTTP 400 before artifact creation or queue mutation.

Worker dry-run/simulate requests that need model-specific planning must pass
`arguments.planning_model_id`, use dry-run
`arguments.planning_profile_id`, or use a known deterministic SIM resource in
Worker settings. Fake or live-looking resource strings do not imply a model.
If an explicit physical planning ID and SIM resource are present, they must
match.
Core-owned command admission validates these requirements and command support
before HTTP `202`, job-directory creation, `request.json`, or queue mutation.

Worker runtime settings may include optional ASRL serial fields under
`settings.serial_options`: `baud_rate`, `data_bits`, `parity`, `stop_bits`,
`flow_control`, `read_termination`, and `write_termination`. Empty or omitted
fields are not applied and do not override the VISA backend or Connection
Expert settings. `read_termination` and `write_termination` accept `CR`, `LF`,
`CRLF`, and `NONE` aliases; `NONE` means no termination override. The boolean
settings `serial_remote` and `serial_local_on_close` request explicit
`SYST:REM` and best-effort cleanup `SYST:LOC` for ASRL resources only.

Ramp List version 2 documents remain accepted with fixed
`enable_output: false` semantics. Version 3 requires `kind:
"powers-tool-ramp-list"`, exact boolean `enable_output`, and 1 to 10 ordered
`segments`. Version 1, missing or non-boolean v3 fields, unknown top-level
fields, and future versions are rejected without conversion or fallback. Each
segment contains `channel`,
`current`, `start_voltage`, `stop_voltage`, `step_voltage`, `delay_ms`, and
`hold_ms`. An optional global `completion_pulse` contains `timing`
(`segment` or `step`), E36312A rear digital `pins`, and `polarity`.

Ramp accepts `completion_pulse_timing`; step timing accepts `delay_ms = 0`
and uses software post-action pulses. Sequence accepts canonical
`trigger-pulse` actions with `channel`, `pins`, `polarity`, and optional
`leave_trigger_configured` for E36312A only. Sequence must not bypass model
feature gates: EDU36311A trigger/native LIST and snapshot/restore remain
disabled, and E3646A protection, trigger/native LIST, snapshot/restore,
completion-pulse, and native LIST remain disabled. Rear pulse pins and output
channels are separate.
Ramp rejects the removed `completion_pulse_mode`,
`completion_pulse_dwell_ms`, `wait_timeout_ms`, and `poll_ms` fields before
artifact creation or queue mutation. Native LIST and trigger wait controls are
accepted only by the relevant Trigger commands.
Post-action pulses modify and restore trigger/rear-pin settings unless
explicitly left configured. Their global `*TRG` may trigger other armed BUS
behavior.
Native `trigger-step` and `trigger-list` reject `fire: true` with Immediate
source, and BUS requests with `wait_complete: true` require `fire: true` in
the same command. Native `trigger-list` arm-only requests require
`leave_trigger_configured: true`; a started LIST without `wait_complete: true`
also requires `leave_trigger_configured: true`. Invalid requests return HTTP
400 before artifact creation or queue mutation.
`trigger-fire` sends global `*TRG`. Requests with `wait_complete: true` require
`channel` as the abort target for a timed-out or interrupted instrument-wide
completion wait; invalid requests return HTTP 400 before artifact creation or
queue mutation.
Native `trigger-list` accepts canonical `bost_list`, `eost_list`,
`trigger_output_pins`, and `trigger_output_polarity`. Per-step pulse lists
must match the voltage step count; enabled pulses require explicit output
pins. These fields cannot be mixed with legacy `completion_pulse_pins`, which
continues to mean a final-step EOST pulse. Invalid requests return HTTP 400
before artifact creation or queue mutation.

## Safety

For live non-dry-run output-affecting Worker commands, both conditions are required before enqueueing:

- Worker config `settings.allow_output_writes: true`.
- Request `arguments.confirm_output: true`.

Rejected commands do not open VISA, enqueue work, write artifacts, or issue partial SCPI.

## Artifacts

Accepted jobs create:

- `request.json`: integer `schema_version: 2`, `command`, and `arguments`.
- `result.json`: final-only CLI-style result envelope with
  integer `schema_version: 2`, `run_id`, `worker_job_id`, `ok`, terminal `status`,
  `command`, `execution`, `request`, `data`, `warnings`, `error`, and
  `metadata`.

`artifact_path` is the job artifact directory, not the `result.json` path.
The final `result.json.command` field uses the existing CLI result command
object shape, for example `{"name": "read-status"}`. This differs from the
HTTP `/command` response, where `command` is the submitted command string.
`result.json` is written atomically only for terminal states. Pending/running
absence of `result.json` is not success. Failed and cancelled jobs also write a
terminal result artifact when the artifact directory is writable.

Terminal artifact `status` is one of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
`ok` is `true` only for `succeeded`.
