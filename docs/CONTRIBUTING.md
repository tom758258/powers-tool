# Contributing to Keysight Powers

Thank you for improving Keysight Powers. Useful contributions include issue
reports, focused bug fixes, English documentation, tests, simulator and fake
instrument improvements, model support, command/workflow support, and
transport/backend evidence.

Keep pull requests focused. Describe any change to a public contract,
instrument-safety behavior, support metadata, or real-instrument validation
scope. Do not combine an unrelated refactor with a model or hardware-safety
change.

## Development setup

Work from the repository root. The root `pyproject.toml` owns the supported
Python version, dependencies, package version, build metadata, and console
entry points. `uv.lock` is the committed reproducibility lock file.

```powershell
uv venv .venv
uv sync --all-extras --locked --link-mode=copy
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

The repository is one distribution, `keysight-powers`; do not create a
component-local distribution. Use focused no-hardware tests while iterating,
then run relevant Core, CLI, WebUI, and documentation/ownership tests. Explain
in the pull request if the full no-hardware suite was not run.

## Architecture and ownership

The three import packages have distinct responsibilities:

- `powers_tool_core` owns model logic, exact live-scope authorization,
  drivers, safety validation, and hardware-facing behavior.
- `keysight_power_cli` is the command-line adapter.
- `keysight_power_webui` is the browser and HTTP adapter.

The dependency direction is `CLI -> Core` and `WebUI -> Core`. Core must not
import either adapter. Frontend enabled/disabled state is UX only; Core is the
final safety and exact-scope authority.

## Testing expectations

Default tests must not need hardware. Add focused fake-session, simulator, or
dry-run coverage for the changed behavior. Run relevant Core, CLI, WebUI, and
documentation/ownership tests, followed by the full no-hardware suite when
practical.

Real-instrument evidence is required before proposing a new model, command,
workflow, SCPI behavior, VISA/backend behavior, transport scope, output setup,
voltage/current limit, OVP/OCP behavior, trigger behavior, snapshot/restore,
sequence behavior, timeout, cleanup, remote/local behavior, or pending-scope
promotion. A passing artifact is evidence for review, not a self-service
support decision.

## Real-instrument validation

The maintained contributor validation harness is
`scripts\live-cli-check.ps1`. Run `-PlanOnly` first; it performs simulator,
dry-run, lint, and expected-failure checks without opening VISA.

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target "<SUPPORTED_TARGET>" `
  -Connection "<USB|LAN|ASRL>" `
  -Resource "<EXPLICIT_VISA_RESOURCE>" `
  -Suite "<SUITE>" `
  -PlanOnly
```

After reviewing the plan, remove `-PlanOnly` only in an interactive session.
Live validation is explicit opt-in, requires confirmation, never scans or
guesses a resource, uses bounded low-power cases, and writes reviewable
artifacts below `.tmp_tests\live_cli_check`. `-Backend "@py"` is an optional
advanced contributor-validation choice when the exact pending scope is
registered; it is not normal product support.

## New models, commands, and capabilities

Physical model enablement follows four explicit stages: `catalog_only`,
`candidate`, `product_active`, and `de_scoped`. Catalog recognition is useful
identity metadata, but it is not a runtime profile. A candidate is accepted
only after its model metadata, model-specific driver, channels, deterministic
simulator identity, capabilities, electrical ratings, setpoint range/limit
metadata, hard limits, safety checks, and tests all exist, together with a
complete exact pending command/feature policy. Ratings and ranges are
independent prerequisites; one does not substitute for the other.

Use this order for a proposed model support expansion:

```text
catalog-only model
→ implement complete model/profile/driver metadata
→ define channels, ratings, ranges, and hard limits
→ add request validation
→ mark candidate
→ register exact command and feature scopes as pending
→ add simulator/fake/no-hardware tests
→ run bounded hidden Validation-mode bootstrap
→ extend the maintained wrapper where appropriate
→ attach complete redacted artifacts
→ maintainer review
→ explicit later promotion
```

Catalog recognition is not a candidate, a candidate is not Product-open, and
a model with missing prerequisites is not pending support. Contributors must
not mark a model candidate until every candidate prerequisite is present. A
new model must not use `GenericScpiPowerSupply` for model-aware output merely
because its SCPI looks similar to an existing model. Promotion requires
accepted exact evidence plus an explicit later policy change; changing only a
stage or attaching a passing artifact does not promote support.

Exact command support is also feature-aware. The first feature kinds are
normalized sequence actions and real trigger sources. Adding a new sequence
action or trigger source requires profile/request validation and an exact
feature entry for every applicable transport/backend scope. Missing feature
metadata fails closed; `feature_pending` remains contributor Validation-mode
only. A validated connection may mix validated and pending features without
opening the pending feature in Product mode. Every applicable pending scope of
a feature-aware candidate command must list the complete profile-supported
feature inventory as `feature_pending`.

## Hidden validation mode

Contributors may use the intentionally hidden bootstrap option
`--validation-allow-pending-live-support` only for a registered pending exact
scope. It is contributor/bootstrap tooling, not a general `--force`, not
normal product support, and not automatic promotion.

The option never bypasses model/profile recognition, detected `*IDN?`,
expected-model mismatch, missing metadata, unsupported commands, hard model or
channel limits, official ratings and setpoint safety, E3646A range
combinations, confirmation, OVP/OCP, trigger restrictions, sequence
restrictions, cleanup, or session close. Missing metadata is not pending support.

For a bounded bootstrap case that is not yet represented by the wrapper, use
the hidden option only after Core recognizes the model, the command is
implemented, ratings/hard limits and request validation exist, the exact
pending scope is registered, and simulator or fake coverage exists:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m keysight_power_cli.cli `
  <COMMAND> `
  --validation-allow-pending-live-support `
  --resource "<EXPLICIT_VISA_RESOURCE>" `
  --model "<EXPECTED_MODEL>" `
  <BOUNDED_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS> `
  --json
```

Do not use this template to enable an unbounded output-on experiment. Extend
the maintained wrapper for formal, repeatable pull-request evidence whenever a
case is reusable.

## Artifact requirements

The wrapper keeps local raw execution files in `private/` and creates a
redacted `shareable/` artifact set. Attach only the files from `shareable/`:
its `report.json`, `summary.md`, and redacted per-command JSON/stdout/stderr
evidence. Never upload or manually copy files from `private/`. Failed or
malformed raw command output remains private; the shareable set records a safe
placeholder when that output cannot be parsed. The shareable set records the
commit SHA, package version, pull-request revision, expected model, detected
manufacturer/model, firmware, redacted serial, transport, backend, exact
wrapper command, target, suite, selected cases, plan-only/live status, exit
codes, failures or partial results, output-state result, error queue, and
cleanup result.

Failed validation is still useful evidence and must not be discarded. Passing
artifacts are candidate evidence only. They do not automatically promote product support.
Skipped or incomplete cleanup is not cleanup-verified evidence. Required
state-changing evidence cannot pass unless safe-off succeeds, outputs are
confirmed OFF, and the final error queue is clean.

## Power-supply safety and privacy

Use no DUT or only a known safe load for state-changing validation. Set an
explicit low voltage and current limit, verify output OFF before and after the
run, and account for OVP/OCP, channel selection, E3646A global-output behavior,
and sequence-step safety. Always provide an explicit resource.

Do not upload a raw resource, private IP address, complete serial number, raw
IDN string, personal filesystem path, or any file from `private/` in a pull
request, public artifact, issue, or documentation. Generated validation
artifacts remain ignored and must not be committed.
