# WebUI Localization Contract

## 1. Purpose And Phase Boundary

This document defines the investigation findings, browser-localization boundary,
initial Traditional Chinese terminology, user-visible text inventory, refresh
rules, and implementation plan for Powers WebUI localization.

P0 is a documentation-only phase. It adds this contract and does not change
production behavior, tests, API behavior, or packaging. The maintained locales
are `en` and `zh-TW`. English is the source locale, a complete locale, and the
mandatory fallback locale. Localization is limited to presentation owned by the
browser WebUI.

The CLI, Core, drivers, SCPI, VISA, transport and backend behavior, API schemas,
workflow file schemas, CSV, JSON, JSONL, logs, exported artifacts, and raw
diagnostics are outside the localization ownership of this contract. Backend
modules are inventoried only where they explicitly provide presentation metadata
or a message source that the browser displays. This does not transfer ownership
of those messages, validation, or diagnostics to the WebUI.

P0 does not implement catalogs, an i18n runtime, DOM localization helpers, a locale
control, or any production prerequisite. It does not alter the English currently
displayed by the application.

## 2. Locked Product Decisions

Future implementation must use these constants and decisions:

```text
SOURCE_LOCALE = "en"
FALLBACK_LOCALE = "en"
SUPPORTED_LOCALES = ["en", "zh-TW"]
LOCALE_STORAGE_KEY = "powers-tool.webui.locale"
```

Initial locale resolution has this precedence:

1. Use the saved locale only when the value under
   `powers-tool.webui.locale` is exactly `en` or `zh-TW`.
2. Otherwise, select `zh-TW` when the browser language matches `zh-TW`,
   `zh-TW-*`, `zh-Hant`, or `zh-Hant-*`.
3. Use `en` for all other browser languages and saved values.

Saved-locale validation and browser-language matching are intentionally
different. A saved locale receives no case folding, underscore replacement, or
other permissive canonicalization; any value other than the exact strings `en`
and `zh-TW` is ignored. Browser-language matching is case-insensitive, first
normalizes `_` to `-`, and then accepts `zh-TW`, a `zh-TW-` prefix, `zh-Hant`, or
a `zh-Hant-` prefix. Other Chinese language tags must not be mapped to `zh-TW`.

The future locale control will be a single button in the upper-right of the main
interface, not inside Device options, Settings, or another menu. It displays the
target language: `繁體中文` in English and `English` in Traditional Chinese.
Changing locale must take effect immediately without reloading the page, update
`<html lang>`, and persist a manual selection using the independent locale
storage key. A localStorage read or write failure must safely fall back without
making the WebUI unusable.

## 3. Ownership And Architecture Boundary

The browser WebUI owns only browser presentation: headings, labels, help text,
option display text, placeholders, titles, ARIA labels, empty states, known
status and summary presentation, and known browser-generated validation or error
presentation.

Core and backend data remain authoritative. Localization must never become an
input to validation, authorization, capability selection, identity selection,
Product admission, support decisions, or runtime behavior. It must not change:

- Real, Simulate, or Dry-run execution semantics or their separate identity
  slots;
- page-local identity reset on reload, the Real-only Live Data restriction, or
  Expected Model as an identity guard;
- fail-closed command admission, Product support, model lifecycle, command
  count, planning model, or planning profile semantics;
- request or response schemas, the Job queue, admitted runtime options, Loop or
  completion-pulse semantics;
- Stop, safe-off, cleanup, local/release, Restore, SCPI, VISA, transport,
  backend, hardware lock, evidence, or Product promotion boundaries.

`app.py`, `commands.py`, and `jobs.py` remain backend-owned. Only explicitly
browser-facing presentation metadata or message sources from those files are in
the inventory. Unknown Core, backend, validation, VISA, SCPI, instrument, HTTP,
support, admission, and rejection details must remain verbatim.

## 4. Non-Translatable Machine Contracts

Display text may be translated, but the following values must neither be
translated nor derived from translated text.

| Contract area | Protected examples | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP interface | API endpoint, HTTP method, status code | Preserve exactly; locale switching makes no request. |
| API schema | Request/response JSON keys, booleans, enum values, schema versions | Preserve exactly in payloads and logic. |
| Commands | Command IDs and command-count semantics | Keep canonical IDs; translate only catalog labels and descriptions. |
| Models and support | Model IDs, Product IDs, support/capability values | Keep authoritative raw values; never infer support from a label. |
| Planning | Planning model IDs and planning profile IDs | Keep submitted and stored IDs unchanged. |
| Execution | `real`, `simulate`, `dry-run` and runtime status values | Translate presentation only; compare canonical state. |
| Device communication | Transport/backend values, VISA resources, SCPI tokens | Preserve verbatim and never interpolate as HTML. |
| Electrical data | Channel values, units, numeric values | Preserve values and units; surrounding labels may be translated. |
| Forms and DOM | Form `name`, form `value`, DOM contract IDs, `data-*` contract values | Translate associated display nodes/attributes only. |
| Workflow documents | File paths, field names, enums, JSON structure, schema versions | Do not translate submitted, saved, previewed, or restored data. |
| Artifacts | CSV/JSON/JSONL fields and machine-readable output | Outside browser localization ownership. |
| Diagnostics | Unknown error, rejection, validation, support, HTTP, VISA, SCPI, and instrument text | Preserve the original text as a visible fallback. |

For example, the display may say `實機（Real）`, `模擬（Simulate）`, or
`Dry-run（規劃）`, while application and API values remain `real`, `simulate`,
and `dry-run`.

## 5. Translation-Key Contract

Translation keys must be semantic, stable, and independent of presentation
wording. Use dot-separated namespaces with lowercase `snake_case` segments.
Do not use a complete English sentence as a key, a DOM ID as the only meaning,
a locale name in a key, or an array index.

The initial namespace set is:

```text
common.*
app.*
locale.*
device.*
resource.*
execution_mode.*
command.*
form.*
workflow.*
ramp.*
ramp_list.*
sequence.*
snapshot.*
restore.*
job.*
result.*
workspace.*
live_data.*
basic_controls.*
status.*
support.*
validation.*
error.*
accessibility.*
```

Keys identify meaning and context, for example
`execution_mode.option.real`, `job.summary.command`,
`live_data.status.waiting`, and `validation.required_field`. Repeated wording
with different meanings may use different keys. A single semantic message should
not receive different keys merely because it appears in several DOM locations.

## 6. Interpolation And Fallback

Dynamic messages use named interpolation such as `{command}`, `{channel}`,
`{count}`, `{model}`, `{path}`, or `{status}`. Positional interpolation is not
allowed. All parameter values are inserted as text with `textContent`, explicit
text nodes, or a fixed safe attribute. Catalog strings and parameters must never
be executed or interpreted as HTML.

Runtime lookup order is:

1. the selected locale key;
2. the English key;
3. an explicitly supplied raw fallback;
4. the semantic key itself as a diagnosable last resort.

A missing `zh-TW` key falls back to English. A missing English key is a catalog
contract failure and must fail catalog validation. Committed `en` and `zh-TW`
catalogs are expected to have key parity; fallback tests should use synthetic
incomplete catalogs rather than intentionally shipping incomplete `zh-TW`.

An unknown semantic presentation key must retain diagnosable content. Unknown
raw Core, backend, validation, VISA, SCPI, instrument, HTTP, support, or
rejection text must be shown unchanged, never replaced with an empty string,
hidden, or treated as HTML.

## 7. Traditional Chinese Terminology Decisions

These are formal initial P0 terminology decisions. Ordinary interface wording
may be refined during P6 terminology QA when it is unnatural or inconsistent.
Machine values, technical tokens, and the non-translatable contracts in section
4 are fixed and cannot change as a translation decision.

| English term | Recommended `zh-TW` display | Keep English token | Context | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real | 實機（Real） | Yes | Execution mode | Makes hardware impact explicit. Canonical value remains `real`. |
| Simulate | 模擬（Simulate） | Yes | Execution mode | Canonical value remains `simulate`. |
| Dry-run | Dry-run（規劃） | Yes | Execution mode | Retain the established technical token. |
| Device | 裝置 | No | Device identity and summary | Use Taiwan terminology. |
| Resource | 資源 | No | Resource selection and scan | Do not translate the resource value. |
| VISA Resource | VISA 資源 | Yes | Communication resource | `VISA` remains a technical token. |

| Restore | 還原 | No | State restoration | Does not change Restore execution semantics. |
| Protection | 保護 | No | OVP/OCP presentation | OVP/OCP tokens may remain English. |
| Trigger | 觸發 | No | Trigger workflow | SCPI and trigger enums remain unchanged. |
| Pulse | 脈衝 | No | Completion pulse | Preserve established semantics. |
| Output | 輸出 | No | Channel output | Boolean and API values remain unchanged. |
| Channel | 通道 | No | Channel selection/status | Channel values remain unchanged. |
| Scan Device | 掃描裝置 | No | Resource scan action | Must not run during locale refresh. |
| Clear | 清除 | No | Clear presentation/history | Locale refresh must not invoke it. |
| Stop | 停止 | No | Job/live action | Does not change stop semantics. |
| Start | 開始 | No | Live/monitor action | Does not start during locale refresh. |
| Run | 執行 | No | Command/workflow action | Does not submit during locale refresh. |
| Status | 狀態 | No | Status label | Raw status remains canonical. |
| Ready | 就緒 | No | Known status | Use only for a recognized semantic state. |
| Busy | 忙碌 | No | Known status | Use only for a recognized semantic state. |
| Failed | 失敗 | No | Known status | Preserve unknown failure detail. |
| Cancelled | 已取消 | No | Known job status | Canonical status remains unchanged. |
| Completed | 已完成 | No | Known job status | Canonical status remains unchanged. |
| Supported | 支援 | No | Product/support summary | Never use the translation for admission. |
| Unsupported | 不支援 | No | Product/support summary | Preserve an unknown support reason. |
| Pending | 待處理 | No | Job state | Use `待驗證` only for support validation context. |

## 8. User-Visible Text Inventory

Treatment values are `translate`, `translate_with_canonical_token`,
`preserve_raw`, `machine_value`, `not_user_visible`, and `out_of_scope`.
P2-P5 references are plans only; P0 changes none of these sources.

## 9. State-Preserving Locale Refresh Contract

Locale switching may regenerate browser presentation only. It must not reload,
call an API, create/submit/cancel/update a Job, start/stop/rebuild an EventSource,
start/stop/request Live Data, start/stop preview or monitor work, change execution
mode, selected command, resource, Expected Model, planning model/profile, write
authorization, form values, workflow documents, or any runtime option. It must
not clear command input, editors, Snapshot/Restore state, Job History, Workspace
Result, Result Detail, Live Data samples/charts/display state, or logs. It must
not rescan resources, request capability/support metadata, dispatch existing
event handlers, or cause VISA, SCPI, transport, or hardware behavior.

Refresh ownership is as follows:

| Surface | Allowed refresh | Forbidden action or prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static HTML | Update registered text and safe attributes in place. | Do not replace interactive containers or dispatch events. |
| Execution mode | P2 updates static radio labels, initial static help, title, and ARIA bindings in place. P3 updates dynamic badges, mode-specific help, identity labels, and Device/Resource summaries from raw state. | Locale refresh must not call `updateExecutionModeUi()` directly because it can modify controls, identity options, commands, or state; never change canonical mode or an identity slot. |
| Device/Resource summary | Re-label existing DOM or redraw from cached raw identity/resource/support state. | No scan, health fetch, selection change, or support request. Cache raw scan and latest health state before relying on redraw. |
| Command catalog | Re-label entries from cached catalog metadata while preserving raw command IDs and selection. | No catalog refetch or selection handler. |
| Command form | Update labels/help/options/validation presentation in place. | Do not call `renderForm()` while it clears/rebuilds controls. A prerequisite is a field-to-key binding or complete raw draft state. |
| Workflow editors | Update headings, labels, buttons, help, and known validation text in place; redraw only from a complete cached raw editor model. | No preview/run/import/export and no loss of invalid drafts, focus, selection, Loop, or completion-pulse state. |
| Basic controls | Update labels and known status wrappers in place. | Never read/write output, protection, trigger, or device state. |
| Job History | Redraw from cached raw command/status plus semantic `{key, params, rawFallback}` descriptors. | Current rendered `label`/`summary` storage is insufficient and must be replaced before retranslation; no Job API action. |
| Workspace Result | Re-label or redraw from cached raw result/status and semantic summary data. | No result clear, refetch, or mutation. |
| Result Detail | Translate only surrounding heading/ARIA; preserve serialized raw JSON exactly. | Never translate keys or values or re-request detail. |
| Live Data | Update controls, known status text, titles, legends, and axis labels in place, or perform a presentation-only redraw using existing cached samples. | Must not fetch, append samples, create/close EventSource, or change monitor/preview state. Redraw must preserve samples, channel/window state, and connection state. |
| Status/log/error presentation | Re-render recognized semantic messages from key/params/raw fallback; retain unknown raw text. | Never infer application state from translated text or hide raw diagnostics. |
| Support summary | Re-render known presentation from cached authoritative support metadata. | No capability/support request and no admission decision from presentation. |

Known unsafe refresh paths include `updateDeviceResourceSummary()`,
`updateExecutionModeUi()`, `updateSelectedCommandState()`, `renderLivePanel()`,
`refreshHealth()`, `handleExecutionModeChange()`, and
`syncSelectedResource()` when they combine presentation with state mutation,
fetching, or event effects. Future work must separate or bypass those effects for
locale refresh rather than invoke them wholesale.

`liveResourceSummary()` currently derives state by comparing option
`textContent` with the English sentence `No live resources found`. It must use
raw state or an option/data sentinel before that surface is localized. Likewise,
Job History needs semantic presentation descriptors, and device scan/latest
health state needs sufficient raw caching. These are implementation
prerequisites for their respective P3/P4 surfaces, not P0 changes and not
blockers to the P1 runtime/catalog work.

Visible strings currently inserted using `innerHTML`, notably command catalog
content and Live Data channel cards, must move to explicit DOM construction and
`textContent` before translated parameters or backend/raw values pass through
those paths.

## 10. Testing And Acceptance Criteria

Future localization work must verify:

- committed English and `zh-TW` catalog key parity and English completeness;
- English fallback using a synthetic missing-translation catalog;
- named interpolation, text-only insertion, and missing/unknown key behavior;
- invalid saved locale handling, browser-language mapping, and storage
  read/write failure behavior;
- initial and runtime `<html lang>` updates;
- static text, placeholders, titles, ARIA labels, option display, and dynamic
  presentation in both locales;
- unchanged machine values, form values, canonical IDs, units, DOM/data
  contracts, API endpoints, and API payloads;
- preservation of unknown raw diagnostics and rejection/support reasons;
- zero API requests and zero Job creation/update/cancellation during locale
  switching;
- no EventSource creation/closure/rebuild and no Live Data acquisition or sample
  append during switching;
- unchanged execution mode, all identity slots, selected command/resource,
  Expected Model, planning model/profile, and write authorization;
- preservation of command form input, every workflow editor, Snapshot/Restore,
  Job History, Workspace Result, Result Detail, logs, cached Live Data samples,
  chart state, and monitor/preview state;
- presentation-only Live Data redraw from cached samples, including translated
  titles, legends, axes, and recognized status text;
- English source-locale literal tests where language is the subject, while
  structure/behavior tests assert semantic keys, raw values, or DOM structure;
- future locale modules in the native module graph, `_webui_shared.py` harness,
  explicit static asset contracts, package contents, and standalone build.

The no-side-effect switching tests must instrument `fetch`, EventSource
construction/closure, reload, Job actions, preview/monitor actions, and state
snapshots. They must compare all protected state before and after multiple locale
switches.

## 11. Planned Implementation Phases

### P1: Catalog And Runtime Contract

P1 completed the dependency-free foundation in `locale_en.js`,
`locale_zh_tw.js`, and `i18n.js`. The locale modules own frozen maintained
catalogs, while the pure runtime owns exact locale validation, lookup and
English fallback, optional raw fallback, named interpolation, and the initial
English singleton. The catalogs were empty at the end of P1 and are populated
with static presentation messages by P2.

### P2: Static Browser Presentation

P2 completed the minimal `dom_i18n.js` binding for text content, placeholders,
titles, and ARIA labels. `index.html` now binds the page title and brand,
Device/Resource static framing, execution radio labels and initial help, serial
controls, initial resource controls, Commands empty state and Run control, and
the static Result framing. English fallback prose remains in the HTML, and the
production singleton applies the English catalog once after the DOM is ready.

P2 preserves form values, IDs, `data-*` values, event bindings, and the existing
`<html lang="en">`. Browser-language detection, storage, a language control,
and runtime switching remain unimplemented until P5. Dynamic execution
presentation, Device/Resource summaries, catalog/forms, workflows, Basic
controls, Job History entries, result content, and Live Data remain assigned to
P3 and P4.

### P3: Device, Resource, Execution, And Command Surfaces

P3 is complete. Device/Resource summaries, resource scan presentation,
known server/device health states, dynamic execution-mode badges and help,
identity labels and selector framing, command categories, maintained command
names and descriptions, and ordinary parameter-driven command forms now use
the production catalogs. Form localization covers labels, maintained
descriptions, compact help, ARIA labels, maintained option display text,
guidance, and command notes while preserving command IDs, parameter names,
option values, model/profile/resource values, and payloads.
Option translation uses parameter context so channel numbers remain channel
values while rear-pin fields use pin wording. Command-specific Trigger Step
labels and Ramp Loop labels retain their semantics during in-place refresh.

Resource scan presentation now uses explicit raw `not_scanned`, `scanning`,
`results`, `empty`, and `failed` state instead of option text. The latest raw
health readiness, hardware-lock, active-job, and failure detail are cached for
presentation-only redraw without a health request. Execution, Device/Resource,
health, command catalog, and ordinary command-form presentation have focused
refresh functions that do not call the state-changing execution-mode path,
select a command, rebuild the current ordinary form, submit/fetch a Job, or
touch EventSource state.
The initial cached health state presents Checking/Unknown until a health
response arrives; busy execution tooltips and Device/Resource toggle
accessibility text are also refreshed without changing control state.

P3 intentionally does not localize specialized workflow editors, Basic
controls, Job History, Workspace Result content, Result Detail content, Live
Data, workflow operational status, or general backend/client result wrappers;
those remain P4. Locale selection, browser-language detection, persistence,
`<html lang>` switching, and the centralized whole-page refresh controller
remain P5.

### P4: Workflows And Dynamic Operational Surfaces

Completed. Workflow editors, Basic controls, Job History, Workspace Result,
Result Detail surroundings, Live Data, and their known browser-owned
status/support/error presentation use the production catalogs. Surface-local
refresh paths update existing editor/control DOM or redraw cached presentation
without dispatching operations. History retains raw Job identity, command,
status, and result data so command labels and known summaries are produced at
render time; workspace summaries likewise render from cached raw results.
Live Data channel cards and protection presentation use explicit DOM nodes and
`textContent`, including cached-sample redraws.

Workflow documents, command and option values, Job IDs, model/resource values,
units, serialized Result Detail JSON, exported artifacts, and unknown backend,
Core, VISA, SCPI, instrument, HTTP, support, validation, and file-parse detail
remain raw. P4 does not add locale selection, browser-language detection,
persistence, `<html lang>` switching, or a centralized whole-page refresh
controller; those remain P5.

### P5: Locale UI And State-Preserving Runtime Switching

Add the upper-right target-language button, initial locale resolution,
persistence, `<html lang>`, and the centralized no-side-effect refresh path.
Verify localStorage failures and repeated switching across populated forms,
editors, history, results, and Live Data. Live Data may redraw from cached
samples for presentation only and must not acquire data or touch EventSource or
monitor/preview state.

### P6: Terminology, Regression, And Distribution QA

Review ordinary Traditional Chinese wording for Taiwan usage, naturalness, and
consistency; refinements must not change machine contracts or technical tokens.
Run complete localization and WebUI regression coverage, text hygiene, package
inspection, standalone native-module validation, and documentation review.

This split follows Powers ownership: execution modes and independent identity
slots require focused P3 work, while Job History, workflow editors, Basic
controls, and Live Data need raw-state and side-effect isolation before the P5
switch can safely refresh them. Meters remains a design reference for catalogs,
fallback, DOM binding, target-language control, and no-side-effect tests, but
Powers modules must not be copied file-for-file.
