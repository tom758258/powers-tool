# WebUI Change Rules

This document is the maintainer and agent-facing working contract for WebUI
polish and reorganization work. It is not an operator guide. It exists to let
UI work move quickly without damaging power-supply, SCPI, VISA, job, live-data,
or cleanup behavior underneath.

Read this file before changing WebUI code. Also read `AGENTS.md`, the WebUI
README, and the current task context.

## Goal

Improve the browser UI only:

- Make the existing WebUI clearer, denser, more polished, or easier to use.
- Preserve the current Core runtime behavior and browser API contracts.
- Leave SCPI, VISA, output, trigger, protection, sequence, snapshot, live-data,
  cancellation, and cleanup behavior untouched unless the user explicitly asks
  for a backend change and confirms the risk.

Assume connected supported power supplies are real hardware. A UI mistake can
set the wrong voltage/current, enable the wrong output, clear the wrong
protection state, or launch a risky workflow, so treat non-visual changes as
high risk.

## Files You May Change For UI Polish

Preferred editable frontend files:

- `src/powers_tool_webui/static/index.html`
- `src/powers_tool_webui/static/styles.css`
- `src/powers_tool_webui/static/app.js`
- `src/powers_tool_webui/static/app-context.js`

Optional, only when a stable UI contract changes or a new public behavior needs
coverage:

- `tests/webui/test_webui_*.py`
- `tests/webui/_webui_*.py`
- `tests/webui/conftest.py`

Optional documentation updates:

- `docs/webui/README.md`
- `docs/webui/USER_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/webui/web-ui-change-rules.md`

Keep edits surgical. Do not touch unrelated files.

## Files And Behavior You Must Not Change

Do not change Core, CLI, package metadata, or WebUI backend behavior for a
visual UI task:

- `src/powers_tool_core/**`
- `src/powers_tool_cli/**`
- `pyproject.toml`
- Backend behavior in `src/powers_tool_webui/app.py`,
  `commands.py`, `jobs.py`, or `server.py`

Do not change any SCPI, VISA, output, trigger, protection, timeout, live-data,
or cleanup behavior. Specifically do not change:

- SCPI commands or command ordering.
- VISA backend, resource selection, or timeout behavior.
- Output-on, output-off, safe-off, apply, set, ramp, ramp-list, trigger, LIST,
  protection, clear, restore, snapshot, or sequence semantics.
- Safety-config interpretation or official rating limits.
- Hardware-lock behavior and real-job serialization.
- Live Data polling interval, hardware read path, stale/error semantics, or
  post-command refresh behavior.
- Cancellation, stop, release/local, close, and cleanup order.
- JSON success/error envelopes, job status values, or event stream semantics.

If a UI idea seems to require any of the above, stop and write the requested
backend/API change as a proposal instead of implementing it.

## Current WebUI Shape

Developer runtime entry point:

```powershell
uv run python -m powers_tool_webui.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7999
```

Local URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7999/
```

The WebUI is an instrument control dashboard:

- Backend: FastAPI/Uvicorn in `src/powers_tool_webui/app.py`.
- Frontend: static HTML/CSS/JavaScript in `src/powers_tool_webui/static/`.
- No Node build step.
- No frontend package manager.
- No external CDN dependency.
- No framework migration unless explicitly approved by the user.

## API Contract To Preserve

Do not rename, remove, or repurpose these endpoints:

- `GET /`
- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/commands`
- `POST /api/jobs`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`
- `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel`
- `GET /api/events?job_id=...`
- `POST /api/live`
- `POST /api/live/{job_id}/stop`
- `GET /api/live/{job_id}/events`

Do not change request payload names in `app.js` unless the backend, tests, and
docs are intentionally changed together by a separate approved backend task.

Important job payload fields currently sent by the UI include:

- `command`
- `runtime`
- `parameters`
- `artifacts`
- `resource`
- `simulate`
- `dry_run`
- `backend`
- `confirm`
- `channel`
- `voltage`
- `current`
- `safety_config`
- command-specific fields generated from `/api/commands`

The UI must continue to use `/api/commands` as the source of truth for command
metadata, confirmation requirements, supported models, disabled commands,
parameter names, and generated forms. Do not invent command or parameter
options in the frontend.

## DOM And Form Contract To Preserve

You may reorganize layout and visual grouping, but preserve functional IDs,
`name` attributes, and `data-*` attributes unless the stable UI contract
changes. Only update static tests for stable contracts; do not lock CSS colors,
layout measurements, helper function names, local JavaScript variable names, or
panel copy as a substitute for behavioral coverage. See the root
[Testing Guidelines](../testing-guidelines.md).

Important IDs and attributes include:

- `resource`
- `resource-select`
- `scan`
- `live-start`
- `server-state`
- `device-state`
- `live-state`
- `live-cards`
- `basic-command`
- `basic-output-all`
- `advanced-command-toggle`
- `basic-command-status`
- `advanced-commands`
- `command-filter`
- `command-categories`
- `command-list`
- `selected-command`
- `command-description`
- `run`
- `confirm`
- `command-form`
- `workspace-summary-content`
- `job-result-panel`
- `job-history`
- `job-result-clear`
- `job-result-toggle`
- `result-panel`
- `result-toggle`
- `result`
- `data-basic-channel`
- `data-basic-output`
- `data-basic-all-output`
- `data-basic-set`
- `data-basic-voltage`
- `data-basic-current`
- `data-channel-card`

Hidden controls must not submit stale values. Disabled and unavailable states
must stay visible enough for operators to understand why an action is blocked.

## Behavior That Must Stay True

The UI may look different, but these behaviors must remain true:

- Health loads from `GET /api/health` and reports hardware-lock state.
- Command metadata loads from `GET /api/commands`.
- Scan Device submits the `list-resources` command through `POST /api/jobs`
  with `live_only: true`.
- Selecting a live resource copies it into the VISA resource input.
- The command rail hides CLI-only, debug, live-data internal, and unsupported
  commands while preserving direct backend rejection for invalid submissions.
- The Basic command panel omits blank Voltage/Current values instead of
  sending them as setpoints.
- Basic output buttons represent fresh Live Data output state; unknown/off is
  not displayed as confirmed ON.
- Output-affecting commands require page-local real-write authorization for
  the current Real resource. The browser uses command `requires_confirm`
  metadata and does not maintain an independent mutating-command list.
- Simulate and Dry-run are no-hardware modes: their runtime payloads never
  include a VISA resource, serial settings, expected identity, or confirmation.
- Live Data is Real-mode only; `/api/live` rejects simulate and dry-run.
- Real hardware jobs are serialized by the WebUI hardware lock.
- Simulate, dry-run, offline metadata commands, and live-data jobs do not
  occupy the real hardware command lock.
- Cancelling an executing job uses the job cancellation path and does not
  directly close VISA resources from the browser.
- Job updates are streamed through `GET /api/events?job_id=...` and shown in
  Job Result / Result Detail.
- Live Data starts through `POST /api/live` and streams through
  `GET /api/live/{job_id}/events`.
- Live Data can be stopped through `POST /api/live/{job_id}/stop`.
- Live Data reads are read-only and must not overlap real hardware command I/O.
- Fresh Live Data can repair model support cache for the selected resource;
  unknown/stale data must not invent support.
- Fresh channel trip state adds a soft guard for direct output commands on that
  channel; safe/off and recovery commands remain available.
- Advanced command forms keep generated controls, JSON Load/Save workspaces,
  Sequence limits, Ramp List limits, Trigger List channel workspaces, and pulse
  option rules aligned with Core command metadata.
- Rear digital pulse controls remain separate from output channels and
  E36312A-only where applicable.

## Visual Design Boundaries

Allowed:

- Improve layout, grouping, spacing, colors, typography, responsive behavior,
  focus states, disabled states, and status readability.
- Reword visible labels when the meaning stays identical.
- Add static helper text only when it reduces operational ambiguity.
- Add purely client-side affordances such as tabs, collapsible panels, badges,
  warnings, summaries, or filters.
- Add small CSS-only motion if it does not distract from instrument safety.

Avoid:

- Marketing-style landing pages. The first screen should remain the usable
  control console.
- Decorative changes that make controls harder to scan.
- Hidden controls that still submit stale values.
- Extra network dependencies.
- A frontend build chain.
- Broad rewrites of `app.js` or its small helper modules when a small change is enough.

For this project, clarity beats spectacle. The UI should feel like a power
supply control console: readable, calm, direct, and hard to misuse.

## When To Ask Before Continuing

Ask the user before implementing if the request requires:

- New backend endpoints.
- New payload fields.
- New commands or command groups.
- New model support or capability rules.
- Any change to SCPI, VISA, output state, trigger timing, LIST behavior,
  timeout, cleanup, stop, release/local, protection, or safety behavior.
- A new dependency, frontend framework, build tool, icon package, charting
  library, or CDN.
- Removing an existing control.
- Changing what Run, Scan Device, Live Data, Cancel, or Basic output controls
  do.

If unsure whether a change is visual or behavioral, treat it as behavioral and
ask.

## Required Checks Before Completion

Run the narrowest relevant checks first:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\webui -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

If WebUI JavaScript changed, also run:

```powershell
node --check src\powers_tool_webui\static\app-context.js
node --check src\powers_tool_webui\static\app.js
```

`app-context.js` owns only pure execution/workspace context helpers. It must
not access the DOM, fetch, EventSource, or mutable application state.
`app.js` owns the DOM/state adapters and loads after the helper through the
explicit script order in `index.html`.

When practical, run broader no-hardware checks:

```powershell
uv run python -m pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

If the local environment lacks dependencies, say exactly what could not run and
why. Do not claim validation that did not happen.

## Manual UI Smoke Checklist

If you can run the app locally, verify:

- The page loads at `http://127.0.0.1:7999/`.
- No browser console errors appear on first load.
- Scan Device updates the live resource selector or reports no live resources
  cleanly.
- Selecting a live resource fills the VISA resource input.
- Basic Voltage/Current blank fields are omitted from setpoint payloads.
- Output-affecting real commands require confirmation.
- Command categories and filtering still expose supported WebUI commands.
- Generated forms show required, optional, and disabled fields clearly.
- Sequence, Ramp List, and Trigger List editors preserve Load/Save behavior.
- Live Data Start/Stop changes state without overlapping command execution.
- Job Result and Result Detail update after a simulated command.
- Mobile width around 390 px does not overlap text or controls.
- Desktop width around 1280 px remains dense but scannable.

Do not perform real-instrument output or trigger experiments unless the user
explicitly asks. If an instrument is connected and the user requests a smoke
test, start with read-only checks, then low voltage/current, explicit channel,
and output-off cleanup.

## Completion Summary

When finished, provide this short summary:

- Files changed.
- What visual/user workflow problem was addressed.
- Any behavior intentionally preserved.
- Tests and checks run, with pass/fail results.
- Manual UI checks run, with viewport notes if relevant.
- Any skipped validation and why.
- Any risk or follow-up that requires backend approval.
