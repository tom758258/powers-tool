# Powers Tool Core

Vendor-neutral Core library and driver layer for controlling supported DC
power supplies safely. Current Product-active and hardware-validated drivers
are for the documented Keysight models; unknown live hardware remains closed.

Core ships inside the single `powers-tool` distribution while preserving
the `powers_tool_core` import boundary. It owns hardware-facing behavior
and is shared by the CLI and WebUI adapters.

## Purpose

This package owns the hardware-facing model logic, safety validation,
transport helpers, simulator support, snapshot handling, and parser-neutral
sequence runtime. It must stay independent from the CLI and WebUI packages.

Use the core package when another Python package needs to call the power-supply
runtime directly. End users should normally use the `powers-tool` console
script included in the same `powers-tool` distribution.

## Physical Identity And Registry Boundary

Core resolves a physical instrument from its reported manufacturer and model
before selecting a model-specific driver. Its physical catalog, lifecycle,
driver, channel, simulator, capability, electrical-range, and safety-coverage
registries use canonical vendor-qualified IDs such as
`keysight-e36312a`. Vendor-specific driver class names remain unchanged.

`RuntimeOptions` keeps the physical and nonphysical identity domains separate:
`planning_model_id` is a canonical physical planning identity,
`expected_model_id` is an optional live safety guard, and
`planning_profile_id` is a nonphysical dry-run profile. `generic-scpi` is not a
physical model or live expected model and is absent from physical registries.

## Live Support Policy Modes

The contributor-validation policy mode admits only registered pending scopes
and commands returned by Core `internal_validation_candidate_inventory()`.
That candidate inventory is currently empty after the 2026-07-17 promotion.
Product mode remains fail-closed, and validation never mutates Product metadata.

`RuntimeOptions.support_policy_mode` defaults to `product`. After Core reads
`*IDN?`, it resolves the reported manufacturer plus model to a canonical
physical `model_id` and validates any expected-model guard. Product execution
then requires an exact `model_id + command + transport + backend + required
feature` scope before command-specific SCPI. Missing, unsupported, and pending
scopes fail closed.

Exact policy evaluation is feature-aware for `sequence_action` and
`trigger_source`. Sequence validates every distinct instrument-relevant
normalized action before its first step; host-only `wait` and `log` actions do
not require live feature entries. `trigger-step` and `trigger-list` validate
their effective BUS or Immediate source before trigger setup. A validated
command scope does not open an unregistered future action/source. Missing,
unknown, unsupported, and Product-mode pending feature entries fail closed;
Validation mode accepts only explicitly registered `feature_pending` entries.
A validated transport/backend parent may mix validated and pending command
features: validated siblings remain Product-open, while each pending feature
remains Validation-only. A transport-pending parent cannot contain a validated
feature.

`powers_tool_core.support_policy.live_support_policy_metadata()` and
`exact_live_support_metadata()` provide JSON-ready display projections without
exposing validation artifacts or mutable registry records. The model-level
projection distinguishes profile support, explicit diagnostic exemptions, and
registered scopes. The exact projection evaluates one detected model,
resource transport, and backend in Product mode for adapter UX; it does not
replace the enforcing runtime gate. These projections use schema version 2 and
canonical `model_id`; they do not expose evidence IDs, artifact paths,
checksums, or private evidence notes. Unevaluated diagnostics distinguish
reported manufacturer/model fields from resolved physical identity and expose
no Product-open command map.

Identity/status diagnostics and pure offline utilities are separate in this
projection. Exempt diagnostics may report exact Product-policy metadata after
a real IDN read without acquiring a model feature scope. If the detected model
has no active exact policy, the diagnostic may still succeed with an
unevaluated, empty support projection; this does not open live commands or
enable Generic fallback. Expected-model mismatches remain validation errors.
Offline-only utilities are marked `offline_only`; they are not diagnostics and
are never reported as Product-open exact live commands.

## Install

From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

For a basic Core/CLI install:

```powershell
pip install .
```

Runtime installs resolve `pyvisa`, PyYAML for sequence YAML support, and the
Python-version TOML fallback where needed. The package does not include a
console script. This project supports Python `>=3.10`; test dependencies come
from the root `dev` extra.

## Test

The default core tests are no-hardware tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\core -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Focused suites are useful when changing specific layers:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\core\test_model_drivers.py tests\core\test_trigger.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\core\test_operations.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Pytest uses the ignored repository-local `.tmp_pytest` directory by default,
so tests do not depend on access to the Windows system temporary directory.
Run pytest from the repository root. For an intentional per-run override, use
`--basetemp .tmp_tests/<purpose>`. Do not use `Local/` for pytest temporary
data or generated test artifacts.

The repository-level validation scripts also exercise Core through the CLI
adapter. Run the model-aware no-hardware preflight before a plan-only live
wrapper check:

```powershell
.\scripts\preflight-cli.ps1 -Target all
.\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 -Target keysight-e36312a -Connection USB -Resource SIM::E36312A -Suite readonly -PlanOnly
```

Live suite checks and hardware pytest are explicit, opt-in hardware checks.
`scripts\live-cli-check.ps1` is the maintained contributor validation harness
and records target/connection/suite/case candidate-evidence artifacts under
`.tmp_tests`; passing artifacts do not automatically promote product support.
See [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributor workflow. For each
active model, `-Suite full` is the complete validation gate for all currently
project-supported LIVE features of that model. With a passing expanded
full-suite record for the approved model and connection, the model's currently
project-supported LIVE features may be opened. Disabled, unimplemented,
out-of-scope, or factory-only features are not implied by the pass. A passing
suite validates only the selected model, connection, suite, and recorded cases;
it does not validate other connection types or every factory instrument
function. Commands, state-changing behavior, and report locations are
documented in the [CLI README scripted validation section](../cli/README.md#scripted-validation).

The independently reviewed 2026-07-17 full-suite evidence opens E36312A `output-on`, `log`,
resource-backed `doctor`, `measure-all`, and real `restore-from-snapshot` on
USB/TCPIP + system VISA; EDU36311A `output-on`, `log`, and resource-backed
`doctor` on USB/TCPIP + system VISA; and E3646A `output-on` plus
resource-backed `doctor` on ASRL + system VISA. These exact scopes are now in
the accepted Product command inventories. Historical evidence remains
unchanged, and passing future wrapper artifacts does not promote them automatically.

## Status

Active package. E36312A, EDU36311A, and E3646A are the current model-specific
targets. Model-specific driver foundations are selected from valid `*IDN?`
responses.
They are the Product-active models. There are currently no candidate models;
E36313A, E36233A, E36441A, and E36155A remain catalog-only, while E36103B and
E36232A remain de-scoped. `generic-scpi` is a no-hardware planning profile, not a
physical-model lifecycle stage.
Channel-list SCPI, snapshot/readback parsing, protection state handling,
sequence loading/planning, safety validation, simulator behavior, and
output-operation planning are covered by no-hardware tests.

E36312A and EDU36311A protection trip reads use channel-list queries. Shared
Core protection status preserves aggregate flags while calculating them from
the selected channels, and the WebUI live-panel read returns parsed model
identity plus channel-local OVP/OCP trip state.

E36312A native trigger/LIST behavior has no-hardware coverage, while product
LIVE execution is limited to exact commands with accepted scopes. Direct
`trigger-fire` and `trigger-pulse` are Product-open only for E36312A USB/TCPIP
with system VISA. Native
LIST execution belongs only to `trigger-list`; Ramp always uses software
setpoint steps. Unsupported models, including EDU36311A, do not expose trigger
dry-run or simulator behavior.

The expanded Full suite requires external operator observation for
`trigger-pulse`; passing a wrapper run still does not automatically promote a
command. Existing Product-open
E36312A `trigger-status`, `trigger-step`, `trigger-list`, and `trigger-abort`
scopes are unchanged.

Historical 2026-07-09 and verified 2026-07-17 full-suite records exist for
E36312A USB/LAN, EDU36311A USB/LAN, and E3646A ASRL / RS-232. Current records
hold promotion-time paths and checksums without making ignored artifacts a
runtime dependency. E3646A USB and LAN remain outside the current scope.

E3646A product LIVE support is ASRL / RS-232 + system VISA and only the exact
commands listed in [Supported Models](supported-models.md), including
`output-on` and resource-backed `doctor`. A feature family does not open other
commands. Software `ramp-list` and step-limited
`sequence` are not native LIST support.

For output workflows, `voltage` is the output voltage setpoint and `current`
is the output current limit/current setting on E36312A, EDU36311A, and
E3646A. Core exposes official programming-range metadata separately from
independent-channel DC output rating safety limits. The manuals document common
SCPI numeric parameter handling, so this metadata does not introduce
decimal-place rejection or silent rounding/truncation in Core.

The adapter boundary is intentionally one-way: core contains driver methods,
SCPI helpers, simulator selection, no-hardware model resolution, and dry-run
planning; CLI and WebUI build `RuntimeOptions`/`OperationRequest` objects and
wrap returned `data` in their own transport envelopes.

Dry-run and simulator planning does not guess a model from arbitrary resource
strings. Output-family, Ramp List, Sequence, protection write, and trigger
planners require `RuntimeOptions.planning_model_id`, an allowed dry-run
`planning_profile_id`, or a known deterministic simulator resource. Returned
plans identify physical and nonphysical planning identities separately.
Fake or live-looking resources such as `USB0::FAKE::E36312A::INSTR` are test
placeholders and must not imply a model. Deterministic SIM resources such as
`USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR` are accepted because they map to known simulator
IDN/model data. Trigger no-hardware planning accepts only E36312A. Live
hardware uses the manufacturer-plus-model IDN resolution. In live mode,
`expected_model_id` is a safety guard: after `*IDN?`, Core requires the
detected canonical `model_id` to match
before setup/write SCPI. The selected model never overrides the IDN-selected
driver.

After that guard, Core enforces exact product support using the resolved
canonical `model_id`, effective command, VISA resource transport, runtime
backend, and required feature. Missing or pending scopes fail closed before
command-specific I/O. This applies equally to direct Core callers and adapter
requests; no validation-mode bypass exists.

## Output Workflow Pulses

Ramp, Ramp List, and Sequence support a strict `loop_count` total iteration
count from 1 through 255. Old Ramp List v2/v3 and Sequence v1 documents imply
one iteration; Ramp List v4 and Sequence v2 persist `loop_count`. Result
`segment_count` and `step_count` remain per iteration. `completed_loops` counts
only whole successful iterations, while `completed_segment_executions` and
`completed_step_executions` are cumulative across iterations.

Completion pulses use E36312A rear digital pins; rear pins are separate from
the selected output channel. Ramp `step` timing pulses after every voltage
write in every iteration, `segment` pulses once after each complete Ramp
iteration, and `loop` pulses once after all iterations. Ramp List keeps its
per-step and per-Segment behavior in every iteration; `loop` pulses once using
the last Segment channel as an internal trigger anchor. Every-step timing
accepts `delay_ms = 0`. Sequence has no top-level completion pulse; its
per-Step `trigger-pulse` action is unchanged.

A Loop-complete pulse is attempted only after the workflow iterations, final
setpoint/output verification, workflow error-queue check, and final
cancellation check succeed. Its result distinguishes `requested`, `attempted`,
`fired`, `completed`, `restored`, `restore_errors`, and
`post_pulse_errors`. Because `*TRG` is sent before trigger restoration, a
restore, post-pulse error-queue, release, or close failure can occur after the
physical pulse. Such failures fail the command without falsely changing the
recorded fired state. `completed_loops` remains complete when only the
terminal Loop-complete pulse fails; a per-iteration Ramp-complete pulse is
part of that iteration and must succeed before its loop is counted.

Ramp and Ramp List leave output state unchanged by default. Optional
`enable_output: true` enables an output only after the current limit and first
voltage setpoint are validated and written, then requires an ON readback.
Normal completion leaves enabled outputs ON and reads their final state again.

Ramp List version 2 keeps `kind: "powers-tool-ramp-list"` and remains accepted
with fixed `enable_output: false` and `loop_count: 1` semantics. Version 3
requires an exact top-level JSON boolean `enable_output` and also implies one
iteration. Version 4 requires both `enable_output` and `loop_count`. Sequence
v1 implies one iteration and forbids `loop_count`; Sequence v2 requires it.
Missing, wrong-type, unknown, legacy, and future-version fields are rejected
before hardware I/O. Explicit CLI loop overrides upgrade supported older
documents internally without mutating the loaded document.

`segment_count` and `step_count` describe one document iteration.
`completed_loops` counts fully completed iterations.
`completed_segments` and `completed_steps` describe the current or most
recently attempted iteration, while `completed_segment_executions` and
`completed_step_executions` are cumulative across iterations. Failed or
cancelled item context contains a 1-based `loop_index` plus its normal Segment
or Step index. Single-iteration successful item shapes remain compatible.

Ramp, Ramp List, and Sequence cancellation is cooperative. After the current
VISA call returns, Core stops future workflow steps and pulses, uses the same
session to request OFF on every supported channel, verifies every channel OFF,
drains the error queue with a 20-read bound, and then lets the owning session
close. Only complete cleanup reports cancellation; an OFF, readback, error
queue, or session-close failure reports `cleanup_failed`. This workflow stop
is not a hardware emergency stop and is separate from `trigger-abort`, which
aborts Trigger/LIST execution without guaranteeing output OFF.
Sequence documents accept the canonical `trigger-pulse` action. Software
pulses snapshot and restore trigger/digital pin settings unless
`leave_trigger_configured` is explicitly requested.
They send global `*TRG`, which may also trigger other armed BUS behavior.
