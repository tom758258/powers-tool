# Powers Tool CLI User Guide

This guide is for operators who receive the built CLI executable or an
already-installed `powers-tool` command to control supported DC power
supplies. The framework is vendor-neutral, while the currently supported
hardware is the exact Product scope in [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md).
It focuses on normal product operation, important limits, and safe behavior.
For command-specific options and usage, run
`powers-tool <command> --help`.

## Start The CLI

Open PowerShell in the folder that contains the CLI executable and check it:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe --version
```

For a formal Windows release, extract the versioned Desktop ZIP and use the CLI
executable from its application root:

```text
powers-tool-<version>-windows-x64.zip
\powers-tool-<version>\powers-tool.exe
```

Use that extracted path in the commands below.

For an already-installed command, replace `.\powers-tool.exe` with
`powers-tool`:

```powershell
powers-tool --version
```

Normal Product use leaves `--backend` unset and uses the default System VISA
path. Specifying another backend does not unlock Product support; unsupported
model, command, transport, backend, or feature combinations still fail closed.
For command-specific options, run `powers-tool <command> --help`.

## Built-in Help

The CLI includes the complete bundled operator Help. For an installed command:

```powershell
powers-tool user-guide
powers-tool user-guide --language zh-TW
```

For the built Windows executable, use:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe user-guide
.\powers-tool.exe user-guide --language zh-TW
```

These commands open the bundled CLI User Guide in the default browser. The Help
is local/offline content bundled with the installed or released product, so it
matches that product version. For one command's arguments and options, use
`powers-tool <command> --help` instead.

## First Live Check

Use this flow when checking a new computer, VISA runtime, connection, or power
supply setup.

1. Confirm the instrument is safe to query and any connected DUT can tolerate
   the existing output state.
2. List only VISA resources that currently answer `*IDN?`:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe list-resources --live-only
```

3. Copy the exact resource string and set a session variable:

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE = "USB0::...::INSTR"
```

4. Run a read-only identity check:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
```

5. Run a read-only measurement or status check before any output action:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe measure --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --log-scpi
.\powers-tool.exe read-status --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
```

Use an explicit resource string for resource-specific live commands. Do not rely
on a script or unattended workflow to guess which instrument should be used.
`list-resources` and `list-resources --live-only` are discovery commands and
can enumerate backend-discovered resources without a pre-supplied resource.

## Resource Listing

For normal live use, prefer:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe list-resources --live-only
```

Plain `list-resources` is passive VISA discovery. It can show stale cached
resources after a device is disconnected or unavailable. `--live-only` opens
each discovered resource, queries `*IDN?`, and prints only resources that
answered.

Use `--verify` when diagnosing stale entries because it reports both live and
failed resources:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe list-resources --verify
```

Add `--json` when copying results into automation:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe list-resources --live-only --json
```

## Resource Variables

Use environment variables to simplify copying and running multiple commands in a session:

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE = "USB0::...::INSTR"
$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE = "ASRL1::INSTR"
```

Please note:
* `$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE` is for generic live USB/LAN examples.
* `$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE` is for RS-232 / ASRL examples. The
  model-specific notes below distinguish E3646A from PSM-2010.
* These are documentation convenience variables, not hidden CLI defaults.
* Live commands still require an explicit `--resource` argument.

## Finite Workflow Loops

Ramp accepts either `--channel N` or `--channels N,N`, but not both. A
multi-channel Ramp applies the same current and voltage path to every selected
channel in model channel order. Progress and completion pulses count logical
voltage steps, after all selected channels finish; the existing single-channel
command remains compatible.

Ramp, Ramp List, and Sequence accept `--loop-count N`. The value is the total
number of complete executions: 1 is the normal single run, 2 restarts once,
and 10,000 is the maximum. Values outside the strict integer range 1 through 10,000
are rejected. For Ramp List and Sequence files, an explicit CLI value wins;
otherwise the file value is used, then 1 for older supported file versions.

Ramp List v5 is the current file format. Each Segment uses `channels` and may
select a different channel combination. Selected channels share that Segment's
current and voltage path and advance in lockstep; v2/v3/v4 files with one
`channel` per Segment remain supported.

Ramp can pulse after every step, after each complete Ramp iteration, or once
after all loops. Ramp List can pulse after every step, after each Segment, or
once after all loops. Loop-complete pulse timing requires at least two total
executions. Sequence keeps its existing per-Step `trigger-pulse` action and
does not add a top-level completion pulse.

## E3646A RS-232 / ASRL

E3646A Product LIVE support is limited to ASRL / RS-232 with a system VISA
backend. Serial overrides are optional: when a setting is omitted, Powers Tool
leaves the corresponding VISA setting unchanged. Consult the [Product LIVE exact-scope matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix)
for the current command inventory. `identify` and `verify` are diagnostics only
and do not open another command. Protection, trigger, snapshot/restore,
completion pulses, and native LIST are not Product-open for E3646A.

E3646A uses `INST:NSEL` channel preselection for setpoint writes and readbacks.
`OUTP ON/OFF` is a global output enable/disable on this model, so output
enable/disable actions can affect the instrument output state globally.
E3646A `ramp-list` and `sequence` are software workflows, not native LIST.
Sequence accepts only supported read-only/output steps; protection, trigger,
snapshot, restore, native LIST, and completion-pulse steps are rejected.

Set the ASRL resource once per PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE = "ASRL1::INSTR"
```

Plain `list-resources` normally does not need serial settings:

```powershell
powers-tool list-resources
```

If Keysight IO Libraries Suite / Connection Expert already has the ASRL
resource configured, try a read-only check without overriding those settings:

```powershell
powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE"
```

To explicitly apply serial settings for one command, pass only the fields you
want to override. The E3646A factory example is 9600 baud, 8 data bits, none
parity, 2 stop bits, and DTR/DSR handshake, but the instrument front-panel
settings may have been changed:

```powershell
powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --serial-baud-rate 9600 --serial-data-bits 8 --serial-parity none --serial-stop-bits 2 --serial-flow-control dtr_dsr --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
```

`--serial-remote` sends `SYST:REM`. `--serial-local-on-close` best-effort
sends `SYST:LOC` during cleanup. These affect remote/local state and are sent
only when explicitly requested.

Useful read/status examples:

```powershell
powers-tool identify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
powers-tool readback --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
powers-tool measure --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 2 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
powers-tool output-state --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
```

For serial read/write termination in PowerShell, use aliases when possible:
`CR`, `LF`, `CRLF`, or `NONE`. `NONE`, omitted, or blank termination means do
not override the VISA setting.

## PSM-2010 RS-232 / ASRL

PSM-2010 Product LIVE operation is also limited to its documented ASRL / RS-232
+ system VISA scope. It uses CH1 and global output control, and Live Data can
report its current LOW/HIGH operating range.

Do not assume the E3646A factory serial example applies to PSM-2010. This guide
does not define a PSM-2010 factory serial profile; use the actual instrument and
VISA configuration, and apply explicit serial overrides only when the setup
requires them. See [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md) for the
current PSM-2010 command scope.

## Read-Only Workflow

Use read-only commands first when validating an instrument:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe identify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
.\powers-tool.exe readback --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
.\powers-tool.exe protection-status --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
.\powers-tool.exe validate-readonly --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
```

These commands query identity, programmed setpoints, measured values, status,
or protection state. They do not intentionally enable outputs.

## Telemetry Logging

CLI `log` performs bounded read-only telemetry and writes paths selected by the
caller:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe log --simulate --model keysight-e36312a --channel all --interval-sec 1 --samples 5 --csv telemetry.csv --jsonl telemetry.jsonl
```

Sequence `log` is only a message/note action; `--log-scpi` traces SCPI traffic
and is not telemetry.

## Output-Affecting Workflow

Output-affecting commands are explicit. Before using them, confirm the
instrument model, channel, DUT wiring, voltage, current limit, and protection
settings.

Set low setpoints without enabling output:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe set --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --json --log-scpi
```

Read back the programmed state:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe readback --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --json --log-scpi
```

Preview the implemented output-enable plan without opening real hardware:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe output-on --dry-run --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1 --json
```

Turn output off when the check is complete:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe output-off --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --json --log-scpi
```

For a short smoke check, keep voltage and current limits low, set the setpoints
first, confirm them by readback, and only enable output after confirming that
the DUT can tolerate it. Turn output off when finished. Do not run output
workflows unattended against an unknown resource.

## Advanced And Safety-Critical Workflows

Use the advanced command families only after the instrument identity, channel,
current limit, output state, and DUT conditions are understood.

`protection-set` changes protection configuration. `clear-protection` clears
protection state and should be used only after the cause of the trip is
understood. Preview supported protection changes with dry-run when practical.

`snapshot` captures instrument state without intentionally enabling output.
`snapshot-diff` compares saved state. `restore-from-snapshot` can reapply
persisted setpoints, output state, and protection state, so inspect the snapshot
and preview the restore plan before using it on live hardware.

Native Trigger STEP/LIST and rear-panel pulse workflows are advanced operations
with exact model/connection scope. On E36312A, a BUS `*TRG` is instrument-wide
and may also affect other behavior that is already armed for BUS trigger.
`Wait complete` and `Leave configured` change whether the command waits for
completion and whether trigger/LIST configuration is restored; use them only
when the intended trigger lifecycle is understood.

Ramp and Ramp List do not enable output unless their explicit output-enable
option is selected. When output enabling is selected, the workflow stages the
required setpoint before enabling output. Normal completion leaves outputs that
the workflow enabled ON; turn them off explicitly when the test is finished.
Omitting output enabling preserves the prior output state.

## Common Commands

| Command | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| `list-resources --live-only` | Find resources that currently answer `*IDN?`. |
| `verify` | Confirm one explicit resource opens and responds. |
| `identify` | Read the model identity. |
| `measure` | Read voltage/current for one channel. |
| `read-status` | Read output status. |
| `readback` | Read programmed setpoints and measured values. |
| `protection-status` | Read protection state. |
| `validate-readonly` | Run a read-only diagnostic pass. |
| `log` | Collect bounded read-only telemetry into CLI-owned CSV/JSONL files. |
| `set` | Set voltage/current without enabling output. |
| `output-on` / `output-off` | Enable or disable output on an accepted exact LIVE scope; dry-run and simulator previews remain available. |
| `safe-off` | Turn output off using the supported safety path. |
| `capabilities` | Inspect model capabilities offline with `--model`, or inspect a selected resource. |

For command-specific options and usage, run
`powers-tool <command> --help`.

## No-Hardware Checks

Dry-run and simulator commands do not open real VISA hardware. When a command
needs model-specific planning, pass a canonical simulation/dry-run model ID with
`--model`, or use a deterministic SIM resource such as
`USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR`.

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe capabilities --model keysight-e36312a --json
.\powers-tool.exe set --dry-run --model keysight-e3646a --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
.\powers-tool.exe readback --simulate --resource USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR --channel all
.\powers-tool.exe trigger-step --dry-run --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1 --source bus --fire
.\powers-tool.exe set --dry-run --profile generic-scpi --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
```

`capabilities --model <canonical-model-id>` is an offline inspection path. It
reports the registered model capabilities without opening VISA, which makes it
useful before choosing a live workflow.

`--profile generic-scpi` is dry-run-only and is exposed only on commands whose
existing support matrix permits Generic planning. It cannot be combined with
`--model` and is invalid in simulator or live execution.

Do not use fake or live-looking resource strings to imply a model in
no-hardware mode. For example, `USB0::FAKE::E36312A::INSTR` is a placeholder,
not a model identity.

For live commands, `--model` accepts a canonical ID such as
`keysight-e36312a` and is an expected-model guard. The CLI still queries
`*IDN?` and uses the detected model for driver selection. If the selected model
does not match the connected IDN model, the command fails before setup or write
SCPI:

```powershell
.\powers-tool.exe set --model keysight-e36312a --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
```

This requires the connected model to be E36312A and does not force the E36312A
driver.

`--model` is not a feature unlock. Unsupported model, command, mode, connection,
backend, or feature combinations fail closed. Product LIVE support is exact by
detected model, command, transport, backend, and required feature; missing or
pending scopes fail closed. A feature family or no-hardware plan does not imply
that every command in that family is product-open. See the
[exact matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix).

## Common Problems

If `powers-tool.exe` is missing, confirm you are in the folder that contains
the CLI executable and use the actual filename from that folder.

If no live resources are found, check instrument power, USB/LAN cabling, VISA
driver visibility, and whether another program is holding the instrument.

If a numeric or query response unexpectedly contains identity-like data,
responses appear shifted or mismatched between commands, or instrument state
changes unexpectedly, first check whether another independent client is
communicating with the same physical instrument. Independent clients on the
same instrument may interfere with SCPI request/response ordering; independent
writers may also change instrument state underneath each other. Stop the other
client or choose an exclusive validation window before retrying.

If plain `list-resources` shows old entries, rerun with `--live-only` for the
normal operator path or `--verify` to diagnose stale VISA cache entries.

If a command refuses to run, read the validation message before retrying. The
CLI intentionally rejects unsupported models, channels, unsafe setpoints, and
missing confirmations before performing risky actions.
If the message says a workflow is disabled for a model, choose a supported
command for that model or use hardware that supports that workflow. Retrying
with `--model` does not enable unsupported features.

If JSON output is needed for logs or automation, add `--json`. Diagnostic SCPI
logs from `--log-scpi` are written separately so JSON stdout remains parseable.
