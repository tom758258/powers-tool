# Powers Tool CLI

## Parameter Admission

The CLI sends argparse-parsed Python primitives to the shared Core command
contract. This preserves valid flag usage while keeping raw Worker/WebUI JSON
fail closed: Core rejects unknown or inapplicable fields, aliases supplied
together, explicit nulls unless documented nullable, and coercible strings or
numbers used in place of exact booleans, integers, or finite numeric fields.

Vendor-neutral CLI adapter for controlling supported DC power supplies.
Current Product-active models are the exact model scopes documented in
[Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md); unknown live hardware remains
fail closed.

The CLI ships inside the single `powers-tool` distribution while
preserving the `powers_tool_cli` import boundary. It exposes the
`powers-tool` console command and adapts operator commands to the shared
`powers_tool_core` runtime.

## Documentation Set

### Built-in CLI Help

`powers-tool user-guide` opens the bundled CLI Help in the default browser;
`powers-tool user-guide --language zh-TW` opens the Traditional Chinese Help.
The bundled pages are generated from the maintained CLI `USER_GUIDE` Markdown
and [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md) documentation. Generated
HTML is presentation output for the runtime bundle, not a separately maintained
documentation source.

## Purpose

This package provides the `powers-tool` console script, command argument
parsing, JSON envelope handling, SCPI logging, command adapters over
`powers_tool_core`, and the local Power Worker daemon used by
orchestrators/agents.

Hardware-affecting commands remain explicit and opt-in; the default package
test suite runs without hardware.

For normal operator workflows, start with the [CLI User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).
This README keeps the detailed command reference, validation paths,
JSON/JSONL contracts, examples, and maintainer-facing CLI behavior in one
place.

## Package Contents

- `powers_tool_cli.cli`: top-level composition and entry point (`build_parser`,
  `main`), explicit wiring of command-owner handlers, and the retained
  Core-delegated handlers (`_run_core_trigger`, `_run_sequence`,
  `_run_restore_from_snapshot`).
- `powers_tool_cli.cli_runtime`: shared resource I/O, safety resolution, JSON
  file helpers, error/exit emission, and direct Core/resource adapters.
- `powers_tool_cli.cli_request`: JSON request envelopes and Core request
  construction (`OperationRequest`, `TriggerRequest`, and related helpers).
- `powers_tool_cli.cli_io`: stable JSON success/error envelope helpers and
  optional `--save-json` output.
- `powers_tool_cli.cli_rendering`: pure human-readable success-line formatters,
  including shared workflow execution notices, for Output, Trigger, plan,
  Sequence, discovery, read-only, inspection, write, workflow, and
  artifact-success summaries.
- `powers_tool_cli.lifecycle_client`: Worker lifecycle HTTP request construction,
  response validation, dry-run handling, lifecycle output, and error mapping.
- `powers_tool_cli.request_primitives`: shared argv parsing and JSON request
  envelope fields, including serial, completion-pulse, and write-verification
  request shapes.
- `powers_tool_cli.runtime_mapping`: runtime identity, execution, support-policy,
  and serial-option mapping for Core requests.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker`: Worker entry point and composition root (`run_worker`),
  with retained public compatibility re-exports; internal/private consumers use
  their owning worker_* modules directly.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_protocol`: Worker schema version, command taxonomy,
  context/request validation, response envelopes, and parameter normalization.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_config`: Worker configuration loading, validation,
  serial option parsing, and event-sink verification.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_state`: thread-safe `WorkerState` tracker for job status,
  events, server references, and cleanup tracking.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_http`: `WorkerHTTPServer`, `WorkerHTTPHandler` endpoint
  orchestration (`/status`, `/stop`, `/cancel`, `/command`), and server shutdown helper.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_execution`: background `job_runner` loop, `_run_job_impl`,
  PyVISA/simulator connection opening, cleanup recording, telemetry logging,
  and Core execution/error mapping.
- `powers_tool_cli.worker_io`: thread-safe event emission (`emit_event`) and
  atomic JSON artifact publishing (`_write_json_artifact_atomic`).
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.discovery`: discovery and generic instrument I/O
  command handlers (`list-resources`, `verify`, `clear`, `error`, `measure`).
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.readonly`: read-only, protection, snapshot artifact,
  hardware-report, and logging command handlers.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.inspection`: `doctor`, `capabilities`, and
  `safety inspect` command handlers.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.manifest`: static `manifest` tool-identity and
  Worker-protocol introspection.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.output_run`: output command execution, dry-run
  planning, and output result adapters.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.trigger_run`: shared Trigger request/configuration
  validation and result-payload helpers. Active Trigger execution is owned by
  `powers_tool_core.trigger`.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.sequence_run`: ramp-list workflow handler and
  shared sequence/Trigger compatibility helpers. Sequence planning and
  execution are owned by `powers_tool_core.sequence`.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.lifecycle`: Worker lifecycle parser registration.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.output`: output command parser registration, runner
  adapter, and JSON request-envelope mapping.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.ramp_list`: independent Ramp List parser
  registration and request-envelope mapping.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.sequence`: sequence command registration and CLI
  request conversion.
- `powers_tool_cli.commands.trigger`: Trigger parser registration, runner
  adapter, and Trigger JSON request-envelope mapping.

Parser construction binds explicit runner callables. Command-family modules
import shared argparse primitives directly from `powers_tool_cli.cli_parser`
and receive only their own execution callback; parsed argparse Namespaces do
not carry the top-level `powers_tool_cli.cli` module or another service-locator
object. Command handlers, parser registration, and request mapping remain
owned by their command-family modules; `cli.py` is the composition root rather
than a re-export facade.

The CLI owns argument parsing, request mapping, human and machine rendering,
JSON/JSONL envelopes, exit-code mapping, and top-level composition. The three
retained root handlers above remain implemented by `cli.py`. Core owns
IDN/model resolution, capability metadata, exact live-support admission, driver
selection, and model-specific execution. `validate-readonly` uses the narrow
`powers_tool_core.readonly.run_validate_readonly()` adapter boundary; it is not
added to `COMMAND_CONTRACTS` or shared command routing. A model that supports
an existing command contract is integrated in Core without a new concrete
driver branch in the CLI.

CLI-only fields such as `measurement_cli_name`, parsed `argparse.Namespace`
values, command aliases, and adapter error text remain adapter concerns rather
than Core schema.

## Requirements

The root [README Install guide](../../README.md#install) is the canonical setup
reference. See [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md) for the exact
Product support matrix; this section does not add support for another model,
transport, or backend.

| Requirement | No-hardware | Live operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | Use the minimum version declared by `pyproject.toml`: `>=3.10`. | The same Python requirement applies. |
| Core/CLI runtime | Install the current `powers-tool` distribution. | Install the current `powers-tool` distribution. |
| No-hardware | Simulator, dry-run, CLI help, and ordinary tests do not require a physical instrument or vendor VISA runtime. | Not applicable. |
| Live hardware | Not applicable. | Requires a supported physical instrument, an external VISA implementation/runtime that PyVISA can load, and an applicable accepted connection/backend scope. Resource-specific live commands require an explicit operator-selected VISA resource; discovery commands can enumerate resources without a pre-supplied resource. |
| Product support | No-hardware availability does not imply live support. | Model-aware live commands follow the exact `model + command + transport + backend + required feature` scope in [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md). Diagnostic exemptions remain limited to their documented diagnostic purpose. |
| Safety | Preview and simulator paths do not enable real output. | Output-affecting commands remain subject to the existing confirmation gates and safety limits. |

Omitting `--backend` uses the default System VISA path through
`pyvisa.ResourceManager()`. In a source checkout, virtual environment, or
installed Python environment, the CLI can pass an optional PyVISA selector such
as `--backend "@py"` or `--backend "@bt"`. The corresponding backend package
must be installed in that environment and loadable by PyVISA.

`@bt` maps to the distinct `pyvisa_bt` support-policy identity. Backend package
installation and PyVISA loadability do not themselves grant Product support;
model-aware live execution still requires an exact Product-open `model +
command + transport + backend + required feature` scope. No current
Product-open exact scope uses `pyvisa_bt`, so model-aware Product live execution
with `--backend "@bt"` fails closed. The packaged
`powers-tool.exe` does not bundle optional Python backend packages such as
pyvisa-py or `pyvisa_bt`, and it does not include a BT runtime or service.

## Install

The root [README Install guide](../../README.md#install) is the canonical
setup reference. From the repository root, synchronize the locked development
and test environment before running the commands in this document:

```powershell
uv sync --all-extras --locked --link-mode=copy
```

Alternatively, for a basic Core/CLI runtime-only environment, use:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --link-mode=copy
```

The primary installed console entry point is `powers-tool`.

The fallback module entry point is:

```powershell
uv run python -m powers_tool_cli.cli doctor --simulate --json
```

The global `powers-tool --version` option prints `powers-tool <package-version>`
and exits without requiring a subcommand or opening VISA.

## Quick Start

Use these commands from the project root to confirm the installed console entry
point, basic CLI/Core loading, and the deterministic simulator no-hardware path:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool --version
uv run powers-tool doctor --simulate --json
```

This Quick Start does not perform live or system-VISA resource discovery, open a
VISA resource, send SCPI, modify physical instrument state, or enable output. It
does not require a physical instrument or vendor VISA runtime.

For normal operator workflows, continue with the [CLI User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).
To use the local browser interface, see the
[WebUI User Guide](../webui/USER_GUIDE.md). Exact live model and connection
coverage is documented in [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md).

## Command Family Index

This is a quick orientation index, not a replacement for
`powers-tool --help` or the detailed examples below.

| Family | Purpose | Representative commands | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup and diagnostics | Installation, discovery, identity, error, and safety checks. | `powers-tool --version`, `doctor`, `manifest`, `list-resources`, `verify`, `identify`, `error`, `clear` | [Resource Discovery And Live Resource Setup](#resource-discovery-and-live-resource-setup); [Power CLI JSON / JSONL Contract](../contracts/power-cli-jsonl-contract.md); `powers-tool --help` |
| Read-only and state | Measurements, readback, output state, capabilities, instrument status, and bounded telemetry. | `measure`, `measure-all`, `read-status`, `readback`, `output-state`, `capabilities`, `log` | [Read-Only Command Examples](#read-only-command-examples); `read-status` is the instrument command. |
| Setpoint and output control | Setpoints, output transitions, safe-off, and guarded output actions. | `set`, `apply`, `output-on`, `output-off`, `safe-off`, `cycle-output`, `smoke-output` | [Output-Affecting Examples](#output-affecting-examples); [Safety Defaults](#safety-defaults) |
| Output workflows | Ramps, ramp lists, and software sequences. | `ramp`, `ramp-list`, `sequence` | [Ramp And Sequence Examples](#ramp-and-sequence-examples); [Safety Defaults](#safety-defaults) |
| Protection | Protection status, configuration, and clearing. | `protection-status`, `protection-set`, `clear-protection` | [Protection And Trigger Examples](#protection-and-trigger-examples); `powers-tool --help` |
| Trigger | Trigger status, setup, firing, abort, pulse, and LIST workflows. | `trigger-status`, `trigger-step`, `trigger-list`, `trigger-fire`, `trigger-abort`, `trigger-pulse` | [Protection And Trigger Examples](#protection-and-trigger-examples); exact feature scope still applies. |
| Snapshot and restore | Capture, compare, report, and restore saved instrument state. | `snapshot`, `snapshot-diff`, `hardware-report`, `restore-from-snapshot` | [Snapshot And Restore Examples](#snapshot-and-restore-examples); [Power CLI JSON / JSONL Contract](../contracts/power-cli-jsonl-contract.md) |
| Worker and automation | Local Worker lifecycle and command submission. | `worker`, `send-command`, `status`, `stop`, `wait-ready` | [Power Worker Daemon](#power-worker-daemon); [Power Worker Contract](../contracts/power-worker-contract.md). `status` is Worker lifecycle status; instrument status is `read-status`. |

Actual live availability remains determined by the exact Product scope for the
model, command, transport, backend, and required feature.

## Test

The default CLI tests are no-hardware tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\cli -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Focused suites:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\cli\test_cli_output_commands.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\cli\test_cli_trigger.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\cli\test_worker.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

The former monolithic `test_cli.py` is split by command family under
`tests/cli/` (for example `test_cli_discovery.py`, `test_cli_generic_io.py`,
`test_cli_output_commands.py`). CLI parser regression tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_parser.py`)
include a Core-to-CLI command completeness drift guard ensuring all formal
Core commands in `COMMAND_CONTRACTS` are present in CLI's `COMMAND_NAMES` inventory.
Shared CLI test helpers live in `tests/cli/cli_test_helpers.py`.

Pytest uses the ignored repository-local `.tmp_pytest` directory by default,
so tests do not depend on access to the Windows system temporary directory.
Run pytest from the repository root. For an intentional per-run override, use
`--basetemp .tmp_tests/<purpose>`. Do not use `Local/` for pytest temporary
data or generated test artifacts.

### Scripted Validation

The following table lists the supported standalone validation entry points.
Run these scripts from the repository root in PowerShell.
Each validation result is limited to the models, connections, suites, and
checks actually exercised; it does not validate the entire model or broaden
Product support. See
[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributor workflow details.

| Script | Hardware use | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts\preflight-cli.ps1` | No hardware | Runs model-aware CLI smoke and deep checks for supported planning and simulator paths. |
| `scripts\live-cli-check.ps1` | Plan-only or explicit live hardware | Runs a selected model-aware CLI validation suite. |
| `scripts\release-acceptance.ps1` | No hardware plus build checks | Runs the release validation workflow. |
| `scripts\batch-validation.ps1` | Selected by switches | Runs selected simulated or live validation tasks. |

Real-instrument validation with `scripts\live-cli-check.ps1` assumes single-client
access to the target physical instrument. Before live execution, confirm that no
other Powers WebUI, CLI, logger, test process, or external VISA application is
using the same physical instrument resource. Independent clients on the same
instrument may interfere with SCPI request/response ordering and may change
instrument state underneath each other. Powers Tool does not enforce
single-client ownership; this is an operator prerequisite for live validation.

#### CLI preflight (`scripts\preflight-cli.ps1`)

`scripts\preflight-cli.ps1` is the no-hardware CLI validation path. It requires
the repository `.venv` CLI (`.\.venv\Scripts\powers-tool.exe`) and never opens
VISA or touches hardware. It exercises supported dry-run and simulator CLI
cases for the selected validation targets.

Run the default preflight from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\preflight-cli.ps1
```

The default `-Target` is `all`, so every registered validation target is
checked. To validate one model only:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\preflight-cli.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a
```

Accepted `-Target` values are:

```text
keysight-e36312a
keysight-edu36311a
keysight-e3646a
gw-instek-psm-2010
```

Use `-Target all` explicitly to rerun all four targets. An unsupported target
name fails with the same supported-target list.

Select the preflight depth with `-Suite`:

- `smoke` runs a fast subset of identity, metadata, and readonly checks.
- `deep` runs the deeper dry-run and simulator cases. With `-Target all`, only
  the deep representatives `keysight-e36312a` and `keysight-e3646a` run.
- `full` (default) runs the complete no-hardware case set for each selected
  target.

Example:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\preflight-cli.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e3646a `
  -Suite deep
```

Preflight artifacts default to `.tmp_tests\cli_preflight`. A custom `-OutputRoot`
may be supplied, but it must remain under `.tmp_tests`. Each run writes a
timestamped directory containing per-target `report.json`, `summary.md`, and
per-command JSON/stdout/stderr artifacts.

#### Live CLI validation (`scripts\live-cli-check.ps1`)

`scripts\live-cli-check.ps1` is the maintained real-instrument validation
wrapper. It requires an explicit `-Target`, `-Connection`, and `-Resource`, and
never scans for or guesses a live resource. Running the script produces
validation evidence only; it does not by itself promote pending support or
change the [Product LIVE exact-scope matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix).

Before using the live wrapper, copy the exact operator-selected VISA resource
into a PowerShell session variable. Use a model- and transport-specific name so
examples stay unambiguous:

```powershell
$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE = "USB0::...::INSTR"
```

The environment variable is a documentation convenience only. The wrapper does
not discover or read it automatically; pass its value explicitly with
`-Resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE"`.

Start with a plan-only run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a `
  -Connection usb `
  -Resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE" `
  -Suite readonly `
  -PlanOnly
```

`-PlanOnly` generates and validates the suite's CLI dry-run and simulator plans
without opening the VISA resource. An explicit `-Resource` is still required so
the planned commands and artifacts represent the intended connection. External
no-hardware preflight (`preflight-cli.ps1` for the same target) still runs by
default in plan-only mode.

To generate only the live plans when preflight has already been run separately,
`-SkipExternalPreflight` may be used with `-PlanOnly`:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a `
  -Connection usb `
  -Resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE" `
  -Suite readonly `
  -PlanOnly `
  -SkipExternalPreflight
```

`-SkipExternalPreflight` is rejected for a real live run.

After reviewing the plan, run the minimal live readonly suite by removing
`-PlanOnly`:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a `
  -Connection usb `
  -Resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE" `
  -Suite readonly
```

A live run first performs external preflight and generates the suite's
no-hardware plans. It then prints possible instrument state changes and
requires an interactive Enter confirmation before any live SCPI is executed.
Redirected stdin cannot approve a live run. State-changing suites use bounded
low-power cases (typically 1 V / 0.05 A) and attempt safe-off cleanup when
`-Restore` is left at its default `$true`.

Supported parameters:

- `-Target`: canonical model ID. Current values are `keysight-e36312a`,
  `keysight-edu36311a`, `keysight-e3646a`, and `gw-instek-psm-2010`.
- `-Connection` (alias `-Transport`): `usb` or `local` for USB; `lan` or
  `network` for LAN/TCPIP; `asrl`, `rs-232`, or `serial` for ASRL/RS-232.
- `-Resource`: the exact operator-selected VISA resource. Mandatory even in
  plan-only mode.
- `-Backend`: optional PyVISA backend selector such as `@py` or `@bt`. Omit it
  to use System VISA. Backend installation and loadability do not grant Product
  support; model-aware live execution still requires an exact Product-open
  `model + command + transport + backend + required feature` scope. `@bt` is
  recognized as the `pyvisa_bt` backend identity, but no current Product-open
  or registered validation-candidate scope uses it.
- `-Suite`: `readonly` (default), `safe-state`, `output`, `protection`,
  `snapshot`, `trigger-list`, `software-sequence`, or `full`.
- `-PlanOnly`: validate and write no-hardware plans without opening VISA.
- `-SkipExternalPreflight`: skip the separate preflight only with `-PlanOnly`.
- `-Restore`: default `$true`. When `$false`, live runs may complete without
  cleanup verification; `-Restore:$false` is not allowed with `snapshot` or
  `trigger-list` live suites.

Per-target suite availability follows the current validation metadata:

- `keysight-e36312a`: `readonly`, `output`, `protection`, `snapshot`,
  `trigger-list`, `software-sequence`, `full`.
- `keysight-edu36311a`: `readonly`, `output`, `protection`, `software-sequence`,
  `full`.
- `keysight-e3646a`: `readonly`, `output`, `software-sequence`, `full`. Live
  validation currently requires `-Connection asrl`.
- `gw-instek-psm-2010`: `readonly`, `safe-state`, `output`, `protection`,
  `snapshot`, `software-sequence`, `full`. Live validation currently requires
  `-Connection asrl`.

For E3646A or PSM-2010 RS-232 validation, set an ASRL resource variable and pass
it explicitly:

```powershell
$env:E3646A_ASRL_RESOURCE = "<operator-selected-ASRL-resource>"

powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e3646a `
  -Connection asrl `
  -Resource "$env:E3646A_ASRL_RESOURCE" `
  -Suite readonly `
  -PlanOnly
```

For LAN validation on Product-open USB/LAN scopes such as E36312A, set the LAN
resource once per session:

```powershell
$env:E36312A_LAN_RESOURCE = "TCPIP0::...::INSTR"

powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a `
  -Connection lan `
  -Resource "$env:E36312A_LAN_RESOURCE" `
  -Suite readonly `
  -PlanOnly
```

For contributor validation against an installed optional backend such as
pyvisa-py on an exact registered pending scope, pass the backend selector
explicitly. The current registered pending validation scope for pyvisa-py is
E36312A or EDU36311A over TCPIP/LAN, not USB:

```powershell
$env:E36312A_LAN_RESOURCE = "TCPIP0::...::INSTR"

powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\live-cli-check.ps1 `
  -Target keysight-e36312a `
  -Connection lan `
  -Resource "$env:E36312A_LAN_RESOURCE" `
  -Backend "@py" `
  -Suite readonly `
  -PlanOnly
```

Live-validation output is written below `.tmp_tests\live_cli_check`:

```text
.tmp_tests\live_cli_check\<timestamp>_<target>_<connection>_<suite>\
```

Each run keeps private raw validation material under `private\` separately from
a shareable artifact set under `shareable\`, and prints the shareable
`report.json` and `summary.md` paths when it finishes. The validation report
records the target, connection, backend scope, suite, package version, Git
HEAD, no-hardware plans, executed cases, cleanup evidence, and result status.

#### Build entry points

These are public build entry points; detailed usage is maintained in the root
[README](../../README.md):

- `scripts\build_desktop.ps1`
- `scripts\build_windows_bundle.ps1`
- `scripts\build_release.ps1`

Formal Windows releases use the unified Desktop ZIP produced by
`scripts\build_release.ps1`.

#### CI quality utilities

These scripts support CI quality checks and are not standalone validation
entries:

- `scripts/check_text_hygiene.py` checks tracked public text for UTF-8,
  BOM, replacement-character, and mojibake hygiene issues.
- `scripts/check_changed_whitespace.py` checks the GitHub Actions event range
  for whitespace errors. It depends on CI event SHA environment variables and
  is not a general local standalone command.

The complete Product-open command inventory remains the
[Product LIVE exact-scope matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix).
Only exact commands in that matrix are opened for normal LIVE use on those
connections. E3646A and PSM-2010 live use remains restricted to ASRL /
RS-232 + system VISA; their USB and LAN paths remain outside the current scope.
PSM-2010 is Product-open for the exact 23 model-aware commands listed in the
Core Product matrix.
Sequence actions and Trigger Step/List sources are also exact feature-policy
requirements. Missing or pending feature entries remain closed in normal CLI
Product mode; a Product-open command does not imply that an unregistered action
or source is open. The CLI model list remains limited to Product-active models.

### Optional Hardware Pytest

The live smoke script is the normal hardware OK gate for operator acceptance.
Run hardware pytest only when you need deeper repeatable hardware regression,
when a changed feature has matching hardware tests, or when validating SCPI,
trigger, protection-setting, or intentional protection-trip behavior beyond
the smoke script.

Hardware integration tests are excluded from normal use unless an explicit
resource is passed. If deeper hardware pytest is needed, run the read-only
hardware suite first:

```powershell
uv run python -m pytest tests\integration -q -m hardware --resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE" --expected-model E36312A
```

Output-affecting hardware pytest additionally requires `--run-output`:

```powershell
uv run python -m pytest tests\integration -q -m hardware_output --resource "$env:E36312A_USB_RESOURCE" --expected-model E36312A --run-output
```

Add `--backend "@ivi"` when needed. Before any output-affecting run, confirm
the expected instrument, disconnect unknown DUTs, and verify the requested
voltage/current are safe.

## Planning Identities And Live Expected-Model Guards

Output-family commands, `ramp-list`, `sequence`, `protection-set`,
`clear-protection`, and trigger workflows use strict model resolution in
`--dry-run` and `--simulate` mode. In these no-hardware planning paths,
`--model` supplies a canonical physical planning ID such as
`keysight-e36312a`. Supported dry-run commands also expose
`--profile generic-scpi` for separate nonphysical planning. The fields are
mutually exclusive. Simulator mode accepts only a physical planning model or
a known deterministic simulator resource such as
`USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR`.
Trigger no-hardware paths are E36312A-only and require `--model keysight-e36312a` or a
known deterministic E36312A SIM resource. The CLI does not infer a model from
arbitrary fake, live-looking, or alias-only resource strings.

Examples:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool set --dry-run --model keysight-e3646a --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
uv run powers-tool readback --simulate --resource USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR --channel all
uv run powers-tool trigger-step --dry-run --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1 --source bus --fire
```

This is rejected because a fake resource is only a placeholder and must not
imply a model:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool trigger-step --dry-run --resource USB0::FAKE::E36312A::INSTR --channel 1 --source bus --fire
```

Deterministic SIM resources are accepted because they map to known simulator
IDN/model data.

In live mode, `--model` is an expected-model guard. The CLI opens the explicit
resource, queries `*IDN?`, resolves manufacturer plus model, and requires the
canonical detected `model_id` to match before command-specific SCPI. The
selected model never overrides the IDN-detected driver.

Unsupported model, command, and mode failures are intentional feature-lock
behavior. `--model` is not a feature unlock: in dry-run/simulate mode it only
selects a physical planning identity, and in live mode it only checks that the
connected canonical identity is expected. `generic-scpi` is available only
through dry-run `--profile` where the existing support matrix permits it.

Live guard example:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool set --model keysight-e36312a --resource "$env:POWER_USB_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
```

This requires the connected `*IDN?` model to be `E36312A`.

Accepted physical planning IDs are defined by Core Product-active metadata and
documented in [Supported Models](../core/supported-models.md). In `--simulate`
mode, `--model` can derive the matching deterministic simulator resource. The
separate `generic-scpi` profile is dry-run-only and is not a live expected model.
If both `--model` and a SIM resource are provided, their models must match.
Unsupported models, including EDU36311A, do not expose trigger
dry-run or simulator behavior.

No-hardware plans distinguish `planning_model_id` from
`planning_profile_id`. Channel validation and `--channel all` expansion use
the resolved planning identity: E3646A expands `all` to CH1 and CH2 and
rejects CH3; PSM-2010 uses CH1; E36312A and EDU36311A expand to CH1, CH2, and CH3;
`generic-scpi` conservatively allows CH1 only.

Trigger/native LIST workflows are E36312A-only. EDU36311A supports
read-only, output, and protection workflows, but trigger/native LIST,
`snapshot`, and `restore-from-snapshot` are disabled in live, simulate, and
dry-run. E3646A supports RS-232 read-only/output workflows plus software `ramp-list` and
step-limited software `sequence`; those workflows are not native LIST support
and reject unsupported protection, trigger, snapshot, restore, native LIST,
and completion-pulse sequence steps. E36103B and E36232A are not active
supported models and are rejected as planning models and live expected-model
guards. If live `*IDN?` reports either model, model-aware commands reject the
instrument instead of falling back to `GenericScpiPowerSupply`; `verify` and
`list-resources --live-only` may still report the raw IDN as diagnostics.

Real CLI measurement keeps generic instruments on channel 1. E36312A and
EDU36311A channels 2 and 3 use IDN-selected channel-list measurement queries.
Real CLI `set` is supported for E36312A and EDU36311A channels 1, 2, and 3,
and for E3646A RS-232 / ASRL channels 1 and 2. It accepts
`--voltage`, `--current`, or both. Omitted setpoints are left unchanged; when
both are supplied, it writes the current limit before voltage. It does not
enable output.

For all active models, `--voltage` is the output voltage setpoint and
`--current` is the output current limit/current setting. Core publishes
official programming-range metadata from the model manuals: E36312A and
EDU36311A use fixed channel ranges, while E3646A has LOW/P8V and HIGH/P20V
range-dependent voltage/current-limit ranges. This metadata does not add a new
CLI range selector, does not silently round or truncate setpoints, and does
not implement hard decimal-place rejection.

Product LIVE support is command-exact, not feature-family-wide. See the
[Product LIVE exact-scope matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix).
The `output-on`, `measure-all`, `trigger-pulse`, `trigger-fire`, `log`,
resource-backed `doctor`, and `restore-from-snapshot` scopes are Product-open
only for the exact model/transport/system-VISA combinations in that matrix.
Other combinations remain fail-closed. Accepted commands
such as `set`, `output-off`, `safe-off`, `apply`, `ramp`, and model-appropriate
read/protection/trigger commands still require an exact accepted
model/transport/backend scope.

Normal CLI operation always uses the product live-support policy. Pending
transport/backend or feature scopes are not normal product support, and no
public force option is available. Unsupported model, command, connection,
backend, or feature combinations fail closed. The CLI does not bypass IDN
selection, expected-model checks, request validation, safety limits,
confirmations, or model feature locks.

`list-resources`, `verify`, `clear`, `error`, `measure`, `identify`,
`protection-status`, `protection-set`, `clear-protection`, and `snapshot` now
execute through shared core runners. The CLI still owns argparse handling,
human text output, JSON success/error envelopes, `--save-json`, and exit-code
mapping.

`snapshot` produces a schema-2 `powers-tool-snapshot` document with raw
manufacturer/model/serial/firmware under `reported_identity` and canonical
`vendor_id`/`model_id` under `resolved_identity`. `restore-from-snapshot`
accepts only that versioned document; legacy, unversioned, and arbitrary
CLI-envelope documents are rejected. `snapshot --snapshot-json PATH` writes
the raw persisted snapshot, while `--json --save-json PATH` writes the full
CLI schema-2 envelope. The paths must differ when both options are used. No
model identity is recovered from a bare reported model string.

Restore validates all restore-relevant persisted fields without coercion.
Channels are positive integers, output and OCP states are JSON booleans, and
setpoints are finite numbers. A value such as `"false"` is rejected rather
than treated as enabled or disabled. `outputs`, `readback`, and
`protection_settings` must be non-empty and contain exactly the same channels;
a protection record remains required when all of its optional protection
values are null. Incomplete documents are rejected rather than partially
restored. CLI `--channel 1` is parsed to an integer before Core validation,
while raw Core/JSON numeric strings are rejected; exact `--channel all`
remains available only for commands that support all-channel selection.

`snapshot --compare PATH` compares the current E36312A snapshot with a
schema-2 snapshot document (directly or as saved CLI envelope data). It ignores `resource` and
`read_count`, uses default tolerances of 0.001 V/A for programmed setpoints,
0.05 V measured voltage, and 0.01 A measured current, and exits `3` when
differences are found.

`ramp` accepts exactly one of `--channel N` or `--channels N,N`. All selected
channels share the same current and voltage parameters and advance in
canonical channel order as one lockstep logical voltage step. The legacy
single-channel form remains unchanged. Ramp sets current limit first, then
steps voltage from `--start-voltage` to the exact `--stop-voltage`; it does not
turn output on or off unless `--enable-output` is supplied and always uses
software setpoint steps. E3646A and EDU36311A real `ramp` do not support
completion-pulse options. `set`, `apply`, `output-on`, `output-off`, and
`ramp` accept `--settle-ms` and `--verify-after-write`; verification failures
return JSON error code `verification_failed` and exit `3`.

`ramp-list` runs 1 to 10 ordered software-setpoint ramp segments through one
VISA session. It validates the complete versioned JSON document and all
generated setpoints before the first hardware write. By default it does not
enable or disable output; explicit `enable_output: true` enables each workflow
channel once. It does not use native LIST or perform automatic safe-off on
ordinary execution failure.
Ramp List v5 lets each Segment select one or more channels. Those channels share
the Segment current and voltage path and advance in canonical lockstep order.

Ramp `--completion-pulse-timing segment` emits once after each complete Ramp
iteration. `--completion-pulse-timing step` emits once after every logical
voltage step,
and `--completion-pulse-timing loop` emits once after all successful
iterations. Every-step timing accepts `--delay-ms 0`.
Rear pulse pins are not output channels. Pulse workflows are E36312A-only, and
`*TRG` may affect other already armed BUS-triggered behavior.

Ramp and inline Ramp List accept `--enable-output`. Ramp writes current and
the first voltage before enabling and verifying output. Ramp List enables each
channel only on its first segment. Normal completion leaves those outputs ON;
omitting the option preserves the prior output state.

`ramp`, `ramp-list`, and `sequence` accept `--loop-count N`, where N is the
total execution count and a strict integer from 1 through 10,000. An explicit
CLI value overrides a document value; otherwise the document value is used,
then 1. Ramp List v2/v3 and Sequence v1 imply 1.

Ramp List version 2 remains accepted with `enable_output: false` and one
iteration. Version 3 requires `enable_output` and implies one iteration.
Version 4 requires exact `enable_output` and `loop_count` fields and may
contain a global `completion_pulse` object. These versions use one `channel` per
Segment. Version 5 is the latest format and requires `channels`,
`enable_output`, and `loop_count`; `channels` is a non-empty list of unique
positive integers. Version 1, malformed values, unknown fields, and future
versions are rejected without fallback. Inline `--segment CHANNEL ...` syntax
is unchanged, but it builds v5 with `channels: [CHANNEL]` and explicitly stores
`loop_count`, including 1.

Core limits Ramp, Ramp List, and Sequence to 1,000,000 logical execution
units. The CLI prints an execution summary before text-mode execution and
warns above 100,000 units; JSON results use the existing warnings field.
Long runs may retain only the first 100 and last 100 result details while
preserving full aggregate counters and truncation metadata.
`--file` takes `enable_output` only from the document and cannot be combined
with the CLI flag. Inline usage accepts
`--completion-pulse-timing`, `--completion-pulse-pins`, and
`--completion-pulse-polarity`; with `--file`, the document is authoritative
and CLI pulse overrides are rejected.

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE = "USB0::...::INSTR"
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --lint --json --file example.ramp-list.json
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --file example.ramp-list.json
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --segment 1 0.1 0 1 0.1 100 0 --segment 2 0.05 0 2 0.2 50 500
```

## Power Worker Daemon

The Powers Tool Worker is a local background service that listens on
localhost and accepts HTTP commands to control supported DC power supplies
asynchronously.

For full details on the REST API, JSONL lifecycle events, and job result
surfaces, see the [Power Worker Contract](../contracts/power-worker-contract.md).
For the orchestrator/agent handoff flow, including ready-event discovery and
artifact-mode-aware terminal result observation, see the
[Power Worker Orchestrator Guide](../contracts/power-orchestrator-workflows.md).

Start the worker in simulation mode on a dynamic port:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool worker --id power_1 --mode simulate --control-port 0
```

Worker requests require top-level `context`. Mode and identity use
`context.mode`, `context.planning_model_id`, `context.expected_model_id`, and
`context.planning_profile_id`; these fields are rejected in `arguments`.
Their valid combinations follow the resolved Worker mode, and identity fields
are rejected in settings. A deterministic SIM resource must match the explicit
physical planning model; Worker provides no identity default. The
`send-command` client requires `--context-json` with the same context object.

`POST /stop` is cooperative: the handler only sets stop state and wakes the
runner. The Worker emits structured `power_cleanup` JSONL events and does not
emit its final `summary` or stop the HTTP server until runner cleanup finishes.

`POST /cancel` is the fixed job-specific cancellation endpoint. It requires
schema 2 and the exact active `worker_job_id`; missing, stale, or mismatched
identity fails closed. It safely cancels Ramp, Ramp List, Sequence, or bounded
Worker `log` without shutting down the Worker. Workflow cancellation performs
safe-off; `log` instead finishes its active sample cycle, preserves telemetry,
and closes normally without issuing output OFF. `/stop` keeps its existing whole-Worker shutdown
meaning. Direct CLI Ctrl+C for those three workflows requests the same
cooperative cleanup; it cannot force-interrupt blocking VISA I/O.

CLI `powers-tool log` writes caller-selected CSV/JSONL paths. Worker `log` is a
bounded, read-only asynchronous job. In `files` mode it writes fixed
`telemetry.csv` and `telemetry.jsonl` files in its own job directory and retains
completed telemetry evidence after cancellation or failure. In `memory` mode it
creates no telemetry files; each telemetry row is emitted as a schema-2 `sample`
stdout JSONL event, and the terminal result retains only a bounded summary. It
is not background telemetry and cannot run beside another active Worker job.
The Sequence action named `log` remains a host-side message, and `--log-scpi`
remains SCPI traffic tracing rather than telemetry.

The Worker is file-backed by default (`--artifact-mode files`): startup creates
the artifact directory and `events.jsonl`, and each accepted job writes
`request.json` and `result.json` under `jobs/<worker_job_id>`. Orchestrators can
opt into `--artifact-mode memory`, which creates no artifact directory, event
file, request/result artifacts, or telemetry files. In memory mode the accepted
response omits `artifact_path`, terminal
`job_finished`/`job_failed`/`job_cancelled` events and `GET /status` `last_job`
carry the full result envelope, and `log` streams each telemetry row as a
schema-2 `sample` stdout JSONL event. Memory mode rejects an explicit
`--events-jsonl` path because stdout is the only event stream.

When started, it outputs a `ready` event on stdout containing the dynamically
assigned control endpoints.

Run the simulator-only orchestrator smoke example:

```powershell
.\examples\worker_orchestrator_smoke.ps1
```

## Examples

### Resource Discovery And Live Resource Setup

List only VISA resources that can be opened and queried with `*IDN?`:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool list-resources --live-only
```

Use this for normal live operation. Text output includes each resource's raw
IDN response so the instrument model is visible. Add `--log-scpi` to show the
verification query and response for each live check.

List VISA resource strings reported by the selected backend without opening
them:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool list-resources
```

This is passive discovery only: a resource string can appear here even when the
instrument is not currently reachable.

For live USB examples below, set the VISA resource once per PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE = "USB0::...::INSTR"
```

### Generic USB Live Examples

Verify that one resource can be opened and queried with `*IDN?`:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE"
uv run powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
```

Clear instrument status and the error queue with `*CLS`:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool clear --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
```

Read the instrument error queue without changing output state:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool error --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --max-reads 20 --log-scpi
```

### E3646A RS-232 / ASRL Examples

E3646A product LIVE support is ASRL/RS-232 + system VISA only. Its exact
product-open model-aware commands are `measure`, `readback`, `read-status`,
`output-state`, `capabilities`, `log`, `set`, `apply`, `output-off`,
`safe-off`, `cycle-output`, `smoke-output`, `ramp`, `ramp-list`, and
`sequence`, `output-on`, and resource-backed `doctor`. `identify` and `verify`
are diagnostics only. Protection, trigger, snapshot/restore, completion pulses,
and native LIST are not product-open.
`ramp-list` is software setpoint stepping, and `sequence` is a step-limited
software workflow for supported output/read-only steps; neither is native LIST.

E3646A uses `INST:NSEL` channel preselection for setpoint writes and readbacks.
`OUTP ON/OFF` is a global output enable/disable on this model, so accepted
commands such as `output-off`, `safe-off`, `cycle-output`, and
`smoke-output` can affect the instrument output state globally even when a
command accepts a channel.
E3646A `sequence` accepts only supported read-only/output steps; protection,
trigger, snapshot, restore, native LIST, and completion-pulse step types are
rejected by the current feature-lock policy.

Set the ASRL resource once per PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE = "ASRL1::INSTR"
```

For repeated examples, keep common ASRL settings in variables:

```powershell
$Base = @("--resource", "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE", "--serial-read-termination", "CRLF", "--serial-write-termination", "LF")
$Remote = @("--serial-remote", "--serial-local-on-close")
```

Plain resource discovery does not need serial options:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool list-resources
```

If Connection Expert already has the ASRL resource configured and verified,
you can let VISA use those settings:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE"
```

Serial settings are explicit only. If omitted, the CLI does not overwrite
VISA backend, Keysight IO Libraries Suite, or Connection Expert serial
settings. If supplied, only those supplied fields are applied to ASRL
resources. The E3646A factory example is 9600 baud, 8 data bits, none parity,
2 stop bits, and DTR/DSR handshake, but the actual instrument front-panel
settings may differ:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --serial-baud-rate 9600 --serial-data-bits 8 --serial-parity none --serial-stop-bits 2 --serial-flow-control dtr_dsr --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
```

`--serial-remote` sends `SYST:REM` after opening the ASRL resource.
`--serial-local-on-close` best-effort sends `SYST:LOC` during cleanup. These
commands affect the instrument remote/local state and are never sent unless
explicitly requested.

Read/status examples:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool identify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
uv run powers-tool readback --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
uv run powers-tool measure --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 2 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
uv run powers-tool output-state --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --serial-remote --serial-local-on-close
```

Supported output examples:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool set @Base @Remote --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --json --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool apply @Base @Remote --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --no-output --json --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool output-off @Base @Remote --channel 1 --json --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool safe-off @Base @Remote --channel 1 --json --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool ramp @Base @Remote --channel 1 --start-voltage 0 --stop-voltage 1 --step-voltage 0.25 --current 0.05 --delay-ms 100 --json --log-scpi
```

`cycle-output`, `smoke-output`, and `apply` without `--no-output`
require `--confirm` when the selected setpoints exceed the configured
confirmation threshold. `set`, `output-off`, `safe-off`, `ramp`, and
`ramp-list` do not require `--confirm`.

For serial terminations, prefer aliases in PowerShell:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool verify --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_ASRL_RESOURCE" --serial-read-termination CRLF --serial-write-termination LF
```

Supported aliases are `CR`, `LF`, `CRLF`, and `NONE`/`none`. `NONE` means do
not set that termination option. Omitted or empty termination fields also mean
do not override the VISA setting. Custom raw strings are still accepted, but
PowerShell may pass values such as `\r` as a literal backslash plus `r`; use
the aliases when you need actual control characters.

### PSM-2010 RS-232 / ASRL Scope

PSM-2010 Product LIVE support is ASRL/RS-232 + system VISA only. Its exact
model-aware scope includes the 23 commands in the Core Product matrix,
including setpoint/output, protection, snapshot/restore, ramp, and software
sequence workflows. Powers Trigger commands and OCP delay
configuration/readback/trigger remain unsupported. USB, TCPIP, GPIB,
pyvisa-py, pyvisa-bt, and custom VISA scopes remain closed.

### Read-Only Command Examples

Measure voltage and current:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool measure --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool measure --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 2 --log-scpi
```

Preview all-channel measurement without hardware, and read product-open live
status:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool measure-all --simulate --json --resource USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR
uv run powers-tool read-status --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
```

Run a full read-only validation pass on E36312A or EDU36311A:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool validate-readonly --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi --save-json logs\validate-readonly.json
```

Read programmed E36312A setpoints and protection state:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool readback --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool protection-status --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
```

For E36312A and EDU36311A, `protection-status` reads OVP/OCP trip flags per
channel. The existing aggregate flags remain available and are calculated as
the OR of the selected channel results.

### Snapshot And Restore Examples

Capture a raw E36312A snapshot that restore can consume, then compare it:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool identify --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool snapshot --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --snapshot-json logs\before.json --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool snapshot --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --compare logs\e36312a-baseline.json
uv run powers-tool snapshot-diff --summary --json --before logs\before.json --after logs\after.json
```

Preview a restore plan and save the plan data without opening VISA:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool restore-from-snapshot --dry-run --json --snapshot logs\before.json --resource USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR --channel all --plan-json logs\restore-plan.json
```

### Protection And Trigger Examples

Preview or confirm E36312A protection actions:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool clear-protection --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --all
uv run powers-tool clear-protection --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --all --confirm --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool protection-set --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --channel all --ovp-voltage 5 --ocp on
uv run powers-tool protection-set --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1 --ocp-delay 0.5 --ocp-delay-trigger setting-change
uv run powers-tool protection-set --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all --ovp-voltage 5 --ocp on --confirm --log-scpi
```

Configure an E36312A rear digital pin as trigger output, arm one output channel
with a no-change STEP trigger sequence, and emit `*TRG`:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool trigger-pulse --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --pin 1 --channel 1 --polarity positive
```

Use `--dry-run --model keysight-e36312a` or a deterministic E36312A SIM resource to
preview trigger SCPI without opening VISA. Trigger dry-run and simulator
behavior is E36312A-only; unsupported models do not expose trigger
no-hardware behavior. The final `*TRG` may also trigger any already armed
BUS-triggered instrument behavior. `trigger-pulse` is Product-open only for
E36312A USB/TCPIP + system VISA in the documented exact scope. Live trigger behavior
for accepted commands remains IDN-driven; a live `--model` only requires the
connected IDN model to match and never overrides connected hardware.

Native E36312A trigger/LIST commands:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool trigger-status --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all
uv run powers-tool trigger-step --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --source bus --fire --wait-complete
uv run powers-tool trigger-list --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage-list 0,1 --current-list 0.05 --dwell-list 0.01 --completion-pulse-pins 1 --fire --wait-complete
uv run powers-tool trigger-list --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage-list 0,1 --current-list 0.05 --dwell-list 0.01 --bost-list on,off --eost-list off,on --trigger-output-pins 1 --source immediate --wait-complete
uv run powers-tool trigger-fire --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1 --wait-complete
uv run powers-tool trigger-abort --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all
```

For native BUS triggers, `trigger-step` and `trigger-list` only arm by default;
add `--fire` to send `*TRG` in the same command. BUS `--wait-complete` requires
`--fire`. Immediate source starts when `INIT` is sent and rejects `--fire`.
Arm-only LIST requires `--leave-trigger-configured`; a LIST that starts without
`--wait-complete` also requires `--leave-trigger-configured`, otherwise restore
would abort it. Trigger Step keeps its existing non-wait behavior. For
`trigger-fire`, `--channel N` is required only with `--wait-complete`; it
selects the output channel to abort if the instrument-wide completion wait
times out or is interrupted. It does not limit the scope of `*TRG` or the
completion wait. Both `trigger-fire` and `trigger-pulse` remain closed for any
other model, transport, or backend.
Canonical Trigger LIST files and flags accept per-step `bost_list` and
`eost_list` plus `trigger_output_pins` and `trigger_output_polarity`. Enabled
pulses require explicit output pins. Legacy `--completion-pulse-pins` remains
a final-step EOST pulse and cannot be mixed with canonical fields. A completed
wait restores the pre-run Trigger settings and LIST table unless
`--leave-trigger-configured` is selected.

### Output-Affecting Examples

Set low E36312A, E3646A, or EDU36311A setpoints without enabling output:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool set --model keysight-e36312a --resource "$env:POWER_USB_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
uv run powers-tool set --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool set --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --log-scpi
```

The first example uses `--model keysight-e36312a` as a live expected-model guard: it
requires the connected `*IDN?` model to be E36312A before any setup/write SCPI.

Real `set` first confirms the selected resource is an E36312A, E3646A, or
EDU36311A with `*IDN?`, then writes only the requested setpoint fields. E3646A
uses channels 1 and 2 with `INST:NSEL` preselection; E36312A and EDU36311A use
channels 1, 2, and 3.

Preview `output-on` without real hardware:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool output-on --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --channel 1
uv run powers-tool output-on --simulate --json --resource USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR --channel all
```

`output-on` is Product-open only for E36312A and EDU36311A USB/TCPIP + system
VISA and E3646A ASRL + system VISA. Other scopes fail closed. E3646A uses one
global output switch after programming both channels; it is not an independent
per-channel output relay.

Read back and cycle output state:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool output-state --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool cycle-output --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --duration-ms 500 --confirm --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool cycle-output --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all --duration-ms 500 --confirm --log-scpi
```

For `cycle-output --channel all`, the CLI enables channels 1, 2, and 3 in
order, waits once for `--duration-ms`, then disables channels 1, 2, and 3 in
order.

Apply low setpoints and enable output:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool apply --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --confirm --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool apply --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --confirm --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool apply --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel all --voltage 1 --current 0.05 --no-output --log-scpi
```

Add an explicit safety config to apply local global limits to output plans:

```toml
[safety]
max_voltage = 5.0
max_current = 0.5
allowed_channels = [1, 2, 3]

[[resources]]
alias = "sim-e36312a"
resource = "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR"
max_voltage = 3.3
max_current = 0.1
allowed_channels = [1]
```

Resource-specific fields override global `[safety]` fields one by one. A raw
`--resource` that matches a `[[resources]].resource` entry also receives that
entry's resource-specific limits; otherwise the global `[safety]` limits apply.

### Ramp And Sequence Examples

Ramp voltage setpoints without changing output state:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool ramp --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --start-voltage 0 --stop-voltage 1 --step-voltage 0.25 --current 0.05 --delay-ms 100 --verify-after-write --settle-ms 200 --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool ramp --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channels 1,2 --start-voltage 0 --stop-voltage 1 --step-voltage 0.25 --current 0.05 --delay-ms 100 --verify-after-write --log-scpi
uv run powers-tool ramp --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --channel 1 --start-voltage 0 --stop-voltage 1 --step-voltage 0.5 --current 0.05 --loop-count 2 --completion-pulse-timing loop --completion-pulse-pins 1 --log-scpi
```

Validate a sequence file or preview deterministic write SCPI without opening
VISA:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool sequence --lint --json --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR" --file examples\sequence-readonly.yaml
uv run powers-tool sequence --dry-run --json --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR" --file examples\sequence-readonly.yaml
uv run powers-tool sequence --dry-run --json --model keysight-e3646a --file examples\sequence-readonly.yaml
uv run powers-tool sequence --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --file examples\sequence-readonly.yaml --loop-count 2
```

Sequence YAML files are formally supported through the core package's PyYAML
runtime dependency. A small built-in parser remains as a fallback for minimal
environments.

Sequence documents also accept `{"action":"trigger-pulse","channel":1,
"pins":[1],"polarity":"positive","leave_trigger_configured":false}`. The
default restores trigger and rear-pin configuration after the pulse.
`leave_trigger_configured` controls only that restore; it does not keep the
pulse trigger armed, and enabling it may affect later steps or other BUS triggers.

Ramp List examples:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --lint --json --file examples\ramp-list.json
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --dry-run --json --model keysight-e36312a --file examples\ramp-list.json
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --dry-run --json --model keysight-e3646a --file examples\ramp-list.json --loop-count 2
uv run powers-tool ramp-list --json --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE" --segment 1 0.1 0 1 0.1 100 0 --segment 2 0.05 0 2 0.2 50 500
```

### Simulator Examples

Clear instrument status and the error queue on a simulated resource:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool clear --dry-run --json --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR"
```

Measure voltage and current on a simulated resource:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool measure --simulate --json --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR" --channel 2
```

Capture a raw snapshot on a simulated resource with redacted resource details:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool snapshot --simulate --redact-resource --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR" --snapshot-json logs\before.json
```

Preview output-affecting commands with no hardware writes:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool set --dry-run --json --resource "USB0::SIM::E36312A::INSTR" --channel 1 --voltage 1 --current 0.05
uv run powers-tool output-on --dry-run --json --model keysight-e3646a --channel all
```

Run offline diagnostics, capabilities, and safety inspect checks:

```powershell
uv run powers-tool doctor --simulate --json
uv run powers-tool capabilities --simulate --json --resource "USB0::SIM::EDU36311A::INSTR" --command protection-set
uv run powers-tool safety inspect --json --explain --safety-config examples\safety-config.toml --resource-alias sim-e36312a --channel 1
```

`capabilities --model <canonical-model-id> --json` inspects Product model
metadata without opening VISA. Its top-level `data.protection_features` has
`ovp_voltage`, `ocp`, `ocp_delay`, and `ocp_delay_triggers` fields. The resource
path reports the same model-aware feature semantics after identity resolution.

The early standalone examples provide the same passive discovery and identity
query behavior:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe examples\01_list_resources.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe examples\02_identify.py --resource "$env:POWERS_TOOL_RESOURCE"
```

Add `--json` to supported CLI commands for the stable machine-readable v1
contract. Diagnostic logs such as `--log-scpi` remain on stderr so JSON stdout
stays parseable. Every JSON success and error envelope includes
`metadata.duration_ms`.

## Safety Defaults

- Output-affecting behavior must be explicit.
- Real product execution is limited to the exact commands and connections in
  the [Product LIVE exact-scope matrix](../core/supported-models.md#product-live-exact-scope-matrix).
  Feature-family, dry-run, simulator, or parser support does not widen it.
- The documented `output-on`, `measure-all`, `trigger-pulse`, `trigger-fire`,
  `log`, resource-backed `doctor`, and `restore-from-snapshot` commands are
  Product-open only in their documented exact scopes; unsupported model,
  connection, backend, or feature combinations fail closed.
- Real `clear`, `error`, and `measure` are safe I/O commands: `clear` sends
  `*CLS` and clears status/error state, while `error` and `measure` only query.
- `--safety-config` is explicit only and applies local plan validation limits;
  it does not enable real hardware output.
- E36312A and EDU36311A setpoints are also bounded by verified official
  independent-channel DC output ratings. Safety config may only lower them.
- Real VISA resources must not be hard-coded in committed files.
- Hardware tests must require a user-provided resource.
- Examples that enable output must set current limit before voltage and turn
  output off in cleanup.
